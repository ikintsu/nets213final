      <strong>CONTENT WARNING</strong>: Some of the articles may be triggering as it may include violent crimes and abuse. Worker discretion advised. 
      <br><br>

      <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        Please read the article below in its entirety and answer the following questions to the best of your ability to identify if the article is about an incident of hate. 
        <br><br>

        <strong>INCIDENT OF HATE</strong>: For our purposes, we are defining an incident of hate as any bias, discriminatory or racist action(s) both verbal or physical taken against a person because of their perceived race. An incident of hate is definitely any hate crime but all incidents of hate are not necessarily hate crimes. 
        <br><br>

        We use the federal definition of a hate crime. A hate crime includes crimes committed based on the victim’s perceived or actual race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability. A hate crime must involve a “crime” and it is often a violent crime, such as assault, murder, arson, vandalism, or threats to commit such crimes.
