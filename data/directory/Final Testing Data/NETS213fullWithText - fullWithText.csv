https://cimsec.org/the-second-most-powerful-man-in-the-world-phillips-obrien-on-admiral-william-leahy/,by dmitry filipoff  cimsec had the opportunity to discuss with phillips payson obrien his latest book the second most powerful man in the world the life of admiral william d leahy roosevelts chief of staff in this conversation obrien sheds light on admiral bill leahys momentous contributions to us strategy and foreign policy in the critical years during and following world war ii as well as his personal style of discreetly exercising influence as the second most powerful man in the world  as the title clearly suggests admiral leahy wielded tremendous power and influence especially during the interwar period wwii and in the immediate aftermath of the war what were the sources of his power and influence that led you to describe him as the second most powerful man in the world  the single most important element in leahys rise to the top of the us government in world war ii was his longstanding friendship with franklin delano roosevelt the two men first met in the navy department in  and grew to not only enjoy each others company but to trust each others instincts in the case of roosevelt this was special roosevelt though outwardly charming was not a naturally trusting individual as he rose up politically he was surrounded by ambitious people trying to take advantage of his power to further their own careers  and he often held them at arms length because of this in the case of leahy he came across someone who was happy not to be in the limelight but motivated to serve his interests first and foremost it was why as soon as roosevelt became president he started promoting leahy up the naval chain of command making sure that the admiral received every major position he could  chief of the bureau of navigation commander of the battle force and culminating in leahys appointment as chief of naval operations    the two men also shared a similar strategic outlook they were committed believers in the importance of a strong american navy and both had been strongly influenced by the ideas of alfred thayer mahan it meant that when they did work together running the american navy in the s they instinctively reinforced each others perceptions and made a very strong team by the time world war ii started for the us the american navy was more the creation of these two men than any others  leahy actually retired formally in  having reached mandatory retirement age however by this time roosevelt had made the decision that if a war did break out in the near future he would want to bring leahy back to help him run it he started discussing such a role with leahy in the spring of  and the two men honed the specifics of the role during the coming years to allow this to happen roosevelt kept leahy employed he first made him governor of puerto rico so that leahy could help build up naval bases in the caribbean he then made leahy ambassador to vichy france both of these positions were a sign of the special trust the president had in the admiral  beyond the close personal relationship between leahy and roosevelt the admiral had a number of key skills he was instinctively political this is discussed in more detail later and he was undoubtedly competent and thorough though not the most deeply intellectual leahy had a way of getting a job done that was invaluable when you combine this with his lack of interest in personal publicity it was a powerful cocktail and made him stand out in a washington dc populated by people who were always on the lookout for personal glory  soon after the us entered wwii it was confronted with a major strategic decision on how it should define specific war production priorities for its tremendous industrial might a decision you described in the book as perhaps one of the most strategic decisions of the war for the us what was admiral leahys role in these deliberations  usually strategy in wwii is seen as some great debate over where and when military force should be used discussions over whether the us should have invaded france in  or  or whether it should fight a germany first war are perhaps the most famous examples of this in our focus on the where and when however what is almost always overlooked is the what all the great powers in world war ii had to decide what to build in terms of equipment force structure how to balance needs between armies navies and air forces as well as within the services such as balancing needs between for example fighters and bombers or tanks and trucks  this was a far more involved process for the us than many realize and william leahy was at the heart of this debate not long after pearl harbor was attacked president roosevelt approved an arms construction plan of enormous depth and breadth which was nicknamed the victory program however by the summer of  it was clear that even with the largest and most powerful economy in the world the us could not build nearly as much equipment as was called for by the victory plan a crisis ensued and hard choices needed to be made in the second half of  about what would be built and even more controversially what would have to be cut  leahy was the most important person in the government except for roosevelt in determining these priorities by this point he was both the presidents chief of staff the closest modern equivalent would be the national security adviser and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff wearing his two hats he fought to cut army construction and focus on aircraft and aircraft carrier construction by december  he had emerged triumphant and both his targets received the highest priority for the us in  and  on the other hand production for the army particularly tank construction was slashed this decision which has received little historical discussion determined what the us could and could not do during the war  another strategic choice that leahy was instrumental in making at this time was about the size of us armed forces the other joint chiefs favored inducting huge numbers of men and women into the forces at one point devising a plan for more than ten million us military personnel that plan however soon clashed headlong with the need to keep skilled personnel working in the economy to produce war material leahy was the only military officer to serve on a small committee chosen by roosevelt to examine the question of military and civilian employment and he came down strongly in favor of more equipment production and a small army his preference was one of the reasons that the us fought the war that it did the united states opted for an equipment heavy personnel light military force structure that kept casualties down  admiral leahy chaired the joint chiefs of staff during world war ii and afterward and also participated in major strategic conferences of the war such as at yalta and potsdam what was his influence on wartime grand strategy and the conduct of wwii  leahy took over as chairman of the joint chiefs holding very different strategic priorities from the chief of staff of the army george marshall looking at the war from an overall perspective leahy did not want the united states to fight a germany first war which marshall and many others including winston churchill strongly supported leahy was worried that if the japanese were allowed to entrench themselves in their pacific empire while the us threw everything into the war against germany that it would have devastating consequences it would he feared take many extra years and a great deal of american blood to take the fight to tokyo  in this leahy walked arm in arm with chief of naval operations ernest king the leahy king alliance ended up triumphing in this fight and contrary to what is widely believed at no time in the war did the united states fight a germany first strategy in  the us fought if anything a japan first war the united states sent more overall equipment to the pacific over europe or north africa in  and  the us fought two different wars the army and army air force did prioritize the war against germany  sending approximately two thirds of their equipment to europe the navy on the other hand sent at least  percent of its strength including one of the largest air forces in the world to fight japan this meant that in overall terms the united states under leahys watchful eye fought a war almost evenly balanced between europe and the pacific but weighed slightly more toward the latter  when it came to the war against germany leahys vision was the one the united states followed more than any other chiefs leahy was the only chief who supported the invasion of north africa in  better known as the torch landings indeed leahy had been the first major policymaker who proposed a north african invasion to roosevelt suggesting such an operation in the summer of  when leahy was ambassador to vichy france leahy believed such an operation would confine germany to the european continent and allow for allied domination of the atlantic understanding leahys strong support for torch helps explain why roosevelt backed the operation over the strong opposition of marshall and king almost immediately after leahy became chief of staff  after torch leahys number one goal for the war in europe was to delay the invasion of france until  he did not want to try an invasion in  which marshall supported because leahy believed it was an unnecessary risk which could result in high us casualties and he also believed it would deprive the war against japan of needed equipment he thus helped undermine the us armys attempt to get british approval for any  invasion however once this was ruled out leahy enthusiastically supported d day in  and helped force the british to accept this position at the grand strategic conferences in washington quebec cairo and tehran which were held in   following the death of his close friend president roosevelt and the end of wwii admiral leahy continued to be highly influential in the truman administration and played a major role in many critical postwar questions how did admiral leahy shape postwar formulations of the us defense establishment and international order  franklin roosevelts death led to a significant change in leahys influence for the two years before fdr died leahy was the most influential policymaker in the white house as harry hopkins who was more influential in  when leahy became chief of staff saw his influence decline however leahy had no pre existing relationship with harry truman and so he immediately lost his preeminent position as a close friend and longtime confidant of the president when roosevelt passed truman also had a very high opinion of people such as george marshall and james byrnes and he started taking their advice more than roosevelt did that being said leahy did maintain a good deal of power after meeting him truman decided he wanted to keep leahy on as his chief of staff and by  they were even on the road to becoming friends leahy for instance became an automatic companion of the president when truman started taking his famous vacations at the naval base in key west florida  the establishment of a strong working relationship with truman allowed leahy to keep influence in a few areas  most importantly relations with the soviet union by the time truman took over leahy had met with stalin twice at tehran in  and yalta in  and had discussed us soviet relations with roosevelt countless times though leahy was never critical of roosevelt he was always instinctively more skeptical about the future of relations with the soviets than the deceased president he believed a long term friendly relationship between the two nations was unlikely and wanted the us to toughen up in its positions  a stance he started urging on the new president  truman almost immediately after becoming president asked leahy for briefings on relations with the soviet union indeed the first time truman met with soviet foreign minister molotov he asked leahy to be in the room with him providing support maybe leahys greatest role in this regard was how he shaped trumans most important speech on soviet relations his navy day address of late  and even more surprisingly winston churchills iron curtain speech of  leahy was the driving force behind the writing of the navy day address as a series of points with a noticeable message about the role of the us in supporting free peoples when churchill heard the navy day address he decided to press ahead with an address of his own which became known as the iron curtain speech churchill discussed this speech with leahy more than any other american indeed they spent one entire morning going through the text when churchill visited washington just before it was delivered churchill was so grateful for leahys advice that years afterward he privately thanked the admiral for it  admiral leahy frequently interacted with many well known individuals of the wwii era including those known for their strong personalities such as admiral ernest king prime minister winston churchill and others how would you describe admiral leahys personal style of leadership and management  leahy was instinctively political and this defined his career for either good or ill depending on your point of view he had the ability to read people and situations and adjust his own responses in such a way to appeal to those with whom he interacted  without revealing his true opinions his lifelong friend and fellow admiral thomas hart claimed that leahy was a born diplomat who always gets on with others in social situations hart claimed that leahy could be as comfortable as an old shoe  this political personal skill was a powerful weapon in his arsenal he could use it on people he genuinely liked such as franklin roosevelt or those of whom he was deeply skeptical such as vice president henry wallace it seems from the moment that leahy met roosevelt in  he found a way to appeal to the young politician to behave in such a way that earned roosevelts trust on the other hand someone like the left wing wallace about whom leahy was intensely skeptical seemed to think that the admiral was a friend or at least thought well of him when that was certainly not the case wallace had no idea that leahy was working to undermine his position when he was secretary of commerce under truman  leahys political skills were evident in his chairmanship of the joint chiefs of staff and his behavior at the great grand strategic conferences of world war ii as chairman or senior member which was what he normally referred to himself as during the war leahy would usually let the other chiefs such as marshall and king go on at great length with discussing their ideas and plans if leahy disagreed he would rarely say so outright but instead in a friendly manner start asking questions of the plan being proposed and in doing so hopefully highlight its weaknesses leahy thus retained the impression of being impartial when at times he was very partial indeed  when dealing with the higher ups such as churchill and stalin leahy normally said as little as possible and when he did speak it was to support the position of the president both churchill and stalin eventually understood how much leahy was valued by roosevelt and by the end of the war treated him with great respect churchill even asked leahy if the two could establish a private channel of communication but leahy not wanting to do anything that would seem disloyal to roosevelt declined  with the worldview and experience that he held toward the end of his career how may have admiral leahy judged us national security strategy as it stands today  when leahys career drew to a close in  he was conflicted about the direction of us foreign policy he has sometimes been inaccurately portrayed as a simple hardline cold warrior leahy had a far more nuanced view he certainly wanted the united states to toughen up its policy vis a vis the soviet union after the end of world war ii and did not believe the wartime alliance was going to continue he also wanted the us to support democratic movements around the world  in a mostly non militarized way  this points out the big difference between what leahy believed and how he has been portrayed while he had no confidence in the future of the us ussr wartime alliance he was also dead set against the us turning into a world policeman deploying troops around the world and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries he was particularly keen to keep the us from becoming an interventionist power in the middle east that is why when president truman in early  decided to intervene in greece and turkey which is often seen as the start of the cold war leahy was strongly opposed he tried to change the presidents mind but to no avail when truman decided to press ahead leahy being the presidential servant that he was publicly supported the move however his heart was not in it until the end of his time in office he did his best to keep the united states from becoming an interventionist power in the middle east he disagreed strongly with truman over the us decision to recognize israel for instance which he believed would lead to decades long religious war in the region  a war that would eventually drag in the us the differences between truman and leahy on the start of the cold war and the middle east were one of the reasons for the decline in leahys influence from  onward  one might describe leahys stance on foreign policy as robust non interventionism he was not apologetic about american power or influence he just did not believe that much could actually be accomplished by interventions in other countries in that sense leahys foreign policy vision could very well have resonance today at the end of world war ii the united states dominated world politics it had half the worlds economic product and its most advanced armed forces though it is still the worlds leading power today it is no longer as dominant as it was then as such the country could benefit by rethinking how and where it should involve itself in the world a leahy like policy of greater restraint and less cost could be

https://kutv.com/news/local/susan-hunts-sister-makes-plea-for-compassion-in-the-face-of-dui-charge,"Susan Hunt has been besieged with personal attacks, including death wishes, since her son Darrien was shot in the back and killed by Saratoga Springs police, according to Hunt's sister -- who made a plea on Friday for compassion and understanding. ""Susan wasn't doing well,"" said Cindy Moss. ""She isn't doing well. I don't know who would be. Who would be for all that's going on?"" She spoke on the same day Susan Hunt was charged in Tooele County with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, reckless driving, and two infractions, in connection with hitting a trooper's patrol car at slow speed near Stockton. 2News asked in what ways Susan has been attacked. ""People have said she should be dead, that her son deserved to die,"" replied Moss. ""That she's a money hungry whatever that she didn't deserve to have her son, that she's a horrible mother. I could go on and on."" In the year-and-a-half since Darrien Hunt was killed, Susan has embarked on a search for answers, filed a civil rights lawsuit against police, had a confrontation of her own with officers, fired a lawyer, and been embroiled in a dispute over a settlement in the civil case. Then came the suspected dui case, in which she was taken to a hospital for treatment. ""I don't know how anyone in this amount of trauma can function like we 'expect' her to,"" said Moss. ""I want people to have compassion and kindness to her."" Moss said she understands not everyone will question police actions, as her family does -- actions deemed justified by the Utah County Attorney, but which also have drawn a U.S. Justice Department investigation. Susan was never a public person before tragic events, said Moss. ""It's traumatic to have this out there for her, to even have her name said, and it's everywhere, to have Darrien name's said. She described her sister as ""quiet, private, and wanting peace.""",FALSE,FALSE

the attorney generals office fgj and the secretariat of citizens security failed to respond adequately to the girls abduction from outside her school last tuesday  there is a chain of negligence at the institutions and to change that we need to know the truth from the beginning to the end when was the first complaint about fatimas disappearance filed  how did all the institutions act she said

simple british programmer  tatarstan along with chuvashia as well as nizhny novgorod oblast and samara oblast has experienced problems the most due to the massive attack by hackers on may   secretary of the russian security council nikolai patrushev stated the media reported that the virus wannacry has affected  countries realnoe vremya is investigating how this attack differs from all previous ones and who in russia has suffered from its action  about how wannacry almost repeated the scenario from terminator  the fridays attack of crypto ransomware wannacry began almost according to the scenario from the movie terminator  when the virus skynet infected computers around the world and eventually launched nuclear missiles at least such thoughts arose among users of social networks when they saw the published map of the virus infected countries  britain and russia have been affected most photo hghltdyandexne  trojan managed to hit more than  computers in over  countries among the countriesthe most affected were britain and russia so in the evening on may  from media reports it became known that the computers of the internal network of the investigative committee as well as the computers of the ministry of internal affairs of russia underwent the hacker attack security officials denied this information mefafon mobile phone operator confirmed that the company computers had been hacked to medusa news on the same day computers of hospitals located in different parts of the uk were attacked users received a mail with the ransom demands the computers of the telecommunications company telefonica in spain were also attacked  secretary of the russian security council nikolai patrushev at a meeting on the issue of terrorism and migration ranked tatarstan as one of the regions most affected by cyber attacks earlier the ministry of information and communications had stated that the state institutions in tatarstan were not affected by the cyber attacks of the virus wannacry  by the way the times assessed how many users took the bait of the swindlers the publication reported that the creators of the virus wannacry earned more than   ordinary users around the world also suffered due to the virus computer users posted in social networks photos of their monitors that showed messages with a ransom demand more often it was the amount of   nikolay patrushev at a meeting on the issue of terrorism and migration ranked tatarstan as one of the regions most affected by cyber attacks photo pravtatarstanru  who are you john connor of our time  but according to the genre for every skynet there must be a john connor indeed in the world such person was found a regular user from britain darien huss can claim the role of the rescuer who managed to stop the attack he wrote under the twitter account malwaretech  after the beginning of the cyber attack darien huss found the unregistered domain name sewn in the malware code where the requests were sent reports the guardian he purchased this domain for less than  under the name iuqerfsodpifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergweacom after that he recorded thousands requests a second sent to him thus domain registration suspended the operation of wannacry  meanwhile a programmer from thailand chanvit caucasi together with colleagues from the technology university of suranari plaza in nakhon ratchasima province created a program block wannacry able to block the virus experts shared the app on the internet for free download reports the nation  i will confess that i was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after i registered it so initially it was accidental     malwaretech malwaretechblog may    what beast is that  wannacry is a crypto virus as well as exploit crypto viruses appearing on your computer encrypt your data as a result the owner of the computer first cant open the files and then receives a message demanding a ransom in exchange for returning the access the virus usually gets into your pc due to errors and negligence of users a wrong click downloading a questionable file installing of extensions  the exploit can be caught even making no mistakes because this type of malware exploits vulnerabilities in software it can attack the computer when the user logs in the website that contains the malicious code through spam or phishing mails according to kaspersky daily the trick is that the discovery of vulnerabilities by hackers the release of an update with fixes takes time when unscrupulous individuals can attack  infection through local network  kaspersky lab claims that the creators of wannacry used the exploit for windows known as eternalblue it exploits the vulnerability that microsoft closed in the security update ms  dated  march  using this exploit the attackers could obtain remote access to computer and install the exploit it is noted that if the update was installed on the computer its system cannot be hacked remotely but if the exploit somehow still turned out to be on your computer then the updates will not save you  after wannacry hacked computer through local network it got on other computers of the network and began to scan them for the presence of vulnerabilities for this reason large companies whose computers are united by a local network suffered more than any other due to the attack  previously realnoe vremya published about the main principles of safe behaviour for computer users  president of microsoft brad smith said that behind wannacry are cia and nsa photo geekwirecom  who did this  secretary of the security council of russia nikolai patrushev stated that it is unsubstantiated to believe that someones intelligence agencies are responsible for the cyber attack wannacry reports ria novosti in his opinion if it was the security services the damage would be more serious president vladimir putin expressed the opinion that the source of such actions is the us intelligence agencies reports interfax  prior to that president of microsoft brad smith said that behind wannacry are cia and nsa the statement on the website of the corporation says that the united states in its own interests gather information about the vulnerabilities of software smith said that only developers should know about the vulnerabilities in microsoft software not the security services he also called the incident a wake up call and a signal for governments to awaken  the telegraph in its publication stated that the cybergroup shadow brokers had relation to the cyber attack according to the newspaper

The institute, held June 17-19 in Seigle Hall, brought together 18 faculty from eight departments in Arts & Sciences and the School of Engineering & Applied Science to develop strategies for incorporating evidence-based teaching practices that can improve student learning and encourage undergraduates to persist in STEM majors. The Teaching Center developed and facilitated STEM FIT, with support from the Association of American Universities’ STEM education initiative. Gina Frey, PhD, the center’s executive director and the Florence E.

https://wset.com/archive/man-says-obama-mask-on-monkey-not-racist,"Craig Co., VA - A Craig County man has stirred up some controversy with a political display-- that includes a monkey statue with a President Obama mask on it. Curtis Caldwell says he cannot stand the President - but claims the monkey itself has nothing to do with the President's race. So he enlisted the help of one of his fake front yard animals, Moe the Monkey, to help get that message out. ""I wasn't trying to make any racial comments about Obama, I just think he's a horrible President. Gotta be defeated. Need to get rid of him,"" said Caldwell. The current Moe is a reminder of another monkey, named Moe, that Caldwell's unit had during the Vietnam War. The new Moe normally sits in a chair greeting people as they come to Caldwell's house. ""He's more than ready to go back to his duties over there. He didn't like this idea in the first place,"" Caldwell joked. Not a chance just yet. Caldwell has a lock on his monkey to make sure he stays put. ""My monkey is expensive. I bought him in Florida a few years ago and I don't want anyone walking off with him,"" said Caldwell. There is no denying that this display is provocative... as it sits beneath a confederate flag for all to see. But he insists the monkey and the man are just coincidence. After all he has other animals in his menagerie... however no other quite fit in the display properly. Still leaves wide open one obvious question: Reporter: ""But you gotta understand there's a history of racists linking monkey's to African Americans. You can understand that?"" ""I do understand that, yes, but if I had a kangaroo or a bear, I would have put the mask on the bear or kangaroo. I just happened to have a statue of a monkey,"" answered Caldwell. Caldwell says the only way he will take that display down before the election is if members of each major party donate $500 to the Craig County Sheriff's Department Christmas Food Bank.",TRUE,FALSE

https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/03/02/youtube-recruiter-sues-google-hiring-mandates.html,"A former recruiter tasked with finding and hiring new engineers at Google sister company YouTube is suing the company, claiming that at one point in his employment he was explicitly told not to hire white and Asian men. Arne Wilberg worked as a recruiter at Google and YouTube parent Alphabet for seven years, but says he was fired in November after complaining to his manager, and later his manager’s manager, about hiring practices he felt were discriminatory. In one case, Wilberg claims his manager sent out a team-wide email around this time last year asking them to “please continue with L3 candidates in process and only accept new L3 candidates that are from historically underrepresented groups.” L3 is an employee classification inside Google. He included a screenshot of a system where recruiters tracked the gender and racial identity of candidates. A screenshot from one weekly tracking report suggests the team had hired just 14 women, against a goal of 82, one black person, against a goal of 21, and five Latinos, against a goal of 13. He claims Google later deleted the tracking system and all references to it in the team’s emails and shared documents on Google Drive. “We have a clear policy to hire candidates based on their merit, not their identity,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement to reporters. “At the same time, we unapologetically try to find a diverse pool of qualified candidates for open roles, as this helps us hire the best people, improve our culture, and build better products.” In 2014, the Mountain View-based company began publicly reporting on its employee diversity, amid calls to hire more women and underrepresented minorities. Last year, 80 percent of Google’s engineers were male, and 92 percent were either white or Asian. The case is the latest in a series of lawsuits from former employees who claim the company’s policies and culture run afoul of employment law. Former engineer James Damore sued Google after he was fired for writing an internal memo arguing, among other things, that women were biologically ill-suited for engineering work. Another engineer, Tim Chevalier, sued Google this month, claiming he was fired for expressing too many politically liberal viewpoints at work. Last week, female Google engineer Loretta Lee sued the company, claiming she was subjected to workplace violence and sexual harassment.",FALSE,FALSE

https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/17/us/harvard-asian-americans-discrimination-complaint/index.html,story highlights a coalition of more than  asian american groups accuses harvard of discrimination they ask federal authorities to investigate harvards admissions policies the university stands by its holistic approach to the admissions process  cnn     a coalition of asian american organizations says the federal government should step in to change harvards approach to admissions accusing the university of racial discrimination  in a complaint filed with the us department of education and the justice department on friday the coalition of more than  groups claims that the university unfairly holds asian american applicants to a higher standard asian americans have the lowest acceptance rates at harvard university and other elite universities the complaint alleges despite having some of the highest test scores and overall academic achievement  people from all over the world came to america for equal opportunities we are trying to bring those principles back to america said yukong zhao a chinese american author who helped organize the coalition this isnt just about discrimination and race it is about justice for everyone including people of all races and social and economic statuses  its an argument that the school staunchly denies and its a case thats been made before in november a lawsuit from students for fair admissions inc challenged harvards admissions policy and argued it discriminates against asian american students  that lawsuit which is pending in federal court and several studies are part of the evidence the coalition points to in its complaint zhao said  the complaint argues that although the total population of asian and pacific islanders has increased in the united states the admission rate for asian americans at harvard university has remained relatively static  harvards general counsel said the universitys admissions policies are fully compliant with the law  in fact within its holistic admissions process and as part of its effort to build a diverse class harvard college has demonstrated a strong record of recruiting and admitting asian american students harvard university general counsel robert iuliano said in an online statement posted in response to the complaint  make it fair  but the coalition   made up of chinese  indian  korean  and pakistani american organizations across the united states   says thats not true  the groups are asking the department of educations office for civil rights and the us justice departments civil rights division to launch an investigation to stop harvard universitys so called holistic approach to admissions  in this approach harvard says it reviews each applicants background and personal characteristics including   when relevant   the applicants race or ethnicity as one of the many factors in its admissions process  chunyan li an assistant professor of accounting at pace university who helped recruit groups to join the complaint said the universitys emphasis on race in the application process is unfair  this approach is subjective li said if it is all implemented objectively then how come all asians on average have such higher scores whats the fairness in this if harvard pushes for a holistic approach then make it fair if you kept emphasizing race then there is no way out  the complaint points to a racial breakdown of sat scores citing the  book no longer separate not yet equal  an asian american student has to score  points higher than a white student  points higher than a hispanic student and  points higher than a black student on the sat to be on equal footing princeton professor thomas j espenshade and rti international researcher alexandria walton radford argue in the book  this year harvard said it accepted  of applicants who applied for a spot in the class of  of the  admitted students  identified as asian american  as latino and  as african american  critics efforts aim to end affirmative action  the november lawsuit and last weeks complaint have drawn fire from some asian american groups who claim the aim of conservative activists behind them is to end affirmative action not to level the playing field for asian american students  what this lawsuit is really is just the latest attempt to derail an apparatus that has given hundreds of thousands of blacks hispanics and yes asians a means to climb out of circumstances defined by our societys historical racism wall street journal opinion columnist jeff yang said in an opinion piece for cnncom last year  two asian american commissioners on the us commission on civil rights said friday that they were concerned about efforts to undermine affirmative action  while we have not reviewed the actual complaint against harvard university we hope that this is a sincerely raised issue and not a back door attack on affirmative action that attempts to pit asian americans against other minorities as other efforts have been michael yaki and karen narasaki said in a statement  harvard says it stands by its approach  we will vigorously defend the right of harvard and other universities to continue to seek the educational benefits that come from a class that is diverse on multiple dimensions iuliano said  cnns catherine e shoichet and cnnmoneys emily jane fox contributed to this

by actor jussie smollett to the current impeachment process being imposed by congress calling both a scam  while speaking to a group of police chiefs in chicago trump railed against the citys police superintendent eddie johnson on a number of fronts and then pivoted to taking on the smollett case  then you have the case of this wise guy jussie smollett who beat up himself trump said and he said maga country did it   maga country  thats a hate crime and its a scam its a real big scam just like the impeachment of your president is a scam  trump claimed smollett is still trying to get away with it he would have been better off if he paid his  bill  chicago mayor lori lightfoot called trump comments during the speech ignorant buffoonery  its no surprise that realdonaldtrump brought his insulting ignorant buffoonery to chicago luckily in this city we know the truth and we will not let anyone    no matter how high the office    denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city lightfoot tweeted following trumps speech  smollett who is gay and black claimed earlier this year to have been the target of a hate crime he has alleged that one of his attackers said this maga country nr  after police investigated the case for weeks they said investigators believed smollett staged the attack to bolster his profile and career  smollett was indicted on  felony counts but weeks later prosecutors unexpectedly dropped all charges smoletts attorney has said he denies making any false claims to investigators  johnson chicagos police superintendent has asserted smollett paid two brothers  to stage the attack and take advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career  a legal battle is currently being fought in federal court as chicago seeks to recover more than  to cover police overtime during the investigation of smolletts report the actor has refused for months to pay the city his attorney has said he wont pay and that he denies making any false claims to investigators  though trump has asserted that the impeachment inquiry is a scam evidence backs up the claims made in the intelligence community whistleblower report about the white houses interactions with ukraine   the report which sparked the inquiry impeachment is also part of a constitutionally spelled out separation of powers  its likely the house will vote to impeach trump

https://www.cnn.com/style/article/freckles-zara-ad-china-beauty/index.html,written by karoline kan beijing china  karoline kan is a beijing based journalist and an editor at china dialogue shes the author of the upcoming book under red skies three generations of love loss and hope in china the opinions expressed in this article belong to the author  i always felt self conscious about my freckles growing up in china they were a rare sight on tv and in magazines but could showing freckles in public really be considered a shameful act that contaminates my countrys image  its a question id never considered until this week when fashion retailer zara sparked widespread debate in china by featuring a freckled model in a campaign for a new range of cosmetics  some social media users slammed the spanish brand for uglifying chinese women others accused zara of misrepresenting asians    and even of outright racism a hashtag for the incident on weibo chinas twitter like microblogging site had appeared in more than  weibo posts and has now been viewed more than  million times  zaras beauty campaign on weibo sparked a debate on chinese beauty standards credit weibo  we asian women dont have freckles    or only a small proportion of us have read one of the most liked comments zara made such an effort finding a model with freckles like searching for a needle in a haystack  the comments were reminiscent of the recent criticism facing another western brand dolce  gabbana which experienced online backlash for a series of promotional videos showing an asian model attempting to eat italian food with chopsticks while much of the anger was directed towards the labels co founder who was accused of sending racist messages an allegation he denied many people also suggested that the italian brand had intentionally chosen an ugly model in order to insult china  those irritated by zaras campaign may hold the stubborn belief    not uncommon in china    that freckles small eyes and dark skin are unattractive to these netizens western brands that use models with these traits are presenting a negative image of china and if you point out that westerners think these models are beautiful it may only make things worse brands are then accused of forcing western aesthetics on chinese people  jing wen pictured during pradas  resort fashion show in shanghai credit yanshan zhanggetty images asiapacgetty images  with a surge in nationalism and patriotism under president xi jinping many in the country are eager to define beauty on their own terms not those imported from overseas it has almost become an issue of cultural sovereignty a commonly used phrase which dictates that only chinese people are qualified to say among other things which chinese women can be considered beautiful  so why are people so sensitive about how theyre viewed in the eyes of the west  at school almost everyone here learns the term used to describe china in the late th and early th centuries sick man of east asia although the phrase was first used in relation to the corrupted and collapsing qing dynasty it was soon interpreted to be a discriminatory western depiction of chinese peoples physiques the image associated with the term was that of a bony opium smoker with pale yellow face and eyes full of laziness  resentment towards this characterization has contributed to extreme sensitivity and even paranoia around how chinese people are portrayed to have westerners depict us in a way thats deemed unhealthy or ugly looking touches a nerve  as one weibo user commented under zaras campaign photos does it mean that us asian women all have dull eyes and have faces fully covered by freckles  a singular definition of beauty  whats ironic is that while many people are easily irritated by western standards being forced on china they despise some of the physical features    such as small eyes and dark skin    that belong naturally to many east asians  chinese photographer chen man shot this portrait entitled chinese medicine in  for id the series depicted chinas ethnic minorities credit chen man  the mainstream beauty standard in china is one of a fair and freckle free face big eyes and high nose bridge while some of these ideals such as fair skin have been popular among han chinese the countrys majority ethnic group since ancient times others like large eyes and a high nasal bridge are more commonly associated with caucasian people  yet this beauty standard continues to prevail in the country advertisements for cosmetic products from both domestic and international brands boast of their ability to whiten skin and remove freckles even food and drink ads for products like coconut juice claim they can whiten skin  in china before posting photos on the social network many women use photo beatification apps to smoothen and whiten their skin and enlarge their eyes its also common for anxious young women to have their freckles removed by laser or going to more extreme lengths surgically enlarging their eyes and shaving their facial bones  fair spotless skin is often associated with being elegant pure and even healthy freckles meanwhile are denounced as dirty ugly and a sign of ill health one of the more absurd comments ive heard from someone promoting traditional chinese medicines was that freckles are a reflection of endocrine system disease  chinese app meitu adds colorful caricature like features such as bigger eyes tear drops and accessories like feathers and flowers to photos credit cnn business  this singular definition of beauty can create problems for those who dont fit within it i grew up thinking my freckles were hated by most people i had been self conscious about them since third grade when a music teacher bluntly asked me why dont you try to remove your freckles  i know you can do that by drinking some herbs medicines and using the laser machine she suggested ive heard similar comments in china time and again they arent meant be malicious but the message is clear freckles are ugly and you might as well remove them for your own good  it was not until in college that my attitude changed and it took another few years before i learned to truly love my freckles i believe they make me unique and beautiful  karoline kan credit karoline kan  slow move toward diversity  the idea of a having single beauty standard is especially bizarre for a country as diverse as china with  officially recognized ethnic groups beauty here is rich and varied while han people often adore angelic freckle free faces other ethnic minority groups such as the dulong people of yunnan province traditionally prefer dark skin and even face tattoos and while in han culture often sees pale and weak looking women to be beautiful women in inner mongolia are considered attractive if theyre good at riding horses  thankfully the strict definition of beauty is slowly loosening take singer wang ju who challenged stereotypes when she rose to prominence last summer through the tv singing competition produce   she is neither fair nor tall    and is noticeably curvier than other women on tv but wang took the country by storm proving to be independent confident and to many beautiful she has since attracted a huge fan base inspiring widespread media debate around beauty and the need for diversity in china  only when there are open discussions will change follow and this is where we see something positive emerging from the zara incident after the initial backlash more and more tolerant positive opinions emerged people voiced support for a campaign that celebrates diversity and praised the model jing wen for being brave and confident enough to show her natural look  chen man tech and art must go together  even the state run newspaper china daily offered its support with an editorial accusing online critics of oversensitivity and a lack of cultural confidence another paper china youth daily said that rather than zara being anti chinese it was those who attacked the chinese model for her looks who are the ones really insulting their compatriot  hopefully zaras campaign    and the debate it stirred    can help change attitudes toward freckles and in time i hope more chinese women can learn to love themselves regardless of whether they meet conventional standards of beauty,TRUE,TRUE

january  she died suddenly initial media reports suggested she took her own life if true she would be the latest in a series of young south korean female entertainers to die by suicide  in addition to uncovering the mental health challenges facing those in the spotlight it shows the alarming trend of suicides among young women in a country already grappling with a high suicide rate  actress oh in hye  took her life last september singer sulli followed by her celebrity friend goo hara ended their own lives months apart in late  male celebrities have also died by suicide in recent years most notably kim jong hyun from the group shinee in december   the reasons behind this disturbing development are many for song and oh it may have been most connected to the waning of their careers for sulli and goo hara more related to the stress of lives in the public eye  sulli had stepped out of the carefully corporate crafted mold of k pop idolatry to expose south koreas societal achilles heel    gender inequality after joining a feminist group advocating women not to wear bras she was bombarded by online trolls which many suggested contributed to her vulnerability  song yoo jungs death has triggered a debate about gender inequality in south korea  mental health under stress  for the last ten years the suicide rate of young south korean women has been increasing by roughly  per year overall south korea has the highest suicide rate in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd club of advanced industrial nations with about  people taking their own lives in  although men still die by suicide more often than women by about  to  more women attempt suicide  several factors drive the phenomenon poverty unemployment gender inequality and gender based violence generational conflict single person households poor parenting inadequate social welfare and perhaps    above all    competition jang soong nang a researcher of social epidemiology at the chung ang university told dw  when it comes to suicide among celebrities jang explains that social media plays a role everything celebrities do and say is revealed manipulated critiqued and sometimes    driven by identity politics    shown hate  the increase in suicide is not due to the so called werther effect jang said arguing that its not a copycat trend what is seen in south korea is an ongoing increase

endless competition  after the   korean war south korea enjoyed rapid economic development but the so called miracle on the han river did not happen without great sacrifice  that ideal of sacrifice coupled with classicism ageism and patriarchy in society creates an insurmountable obstacle for the modern perhaps ambitious unconventional young woman  the way to success is seen as paved by education dependent on the brand of the institute attended like the sky universities for graduates of seoul national korea and yonsei universities doors open for others its more of a struggle  there is endless competition they are just enduring life day to day staying alive itself is very tough its a suffering and the only happiness they feel is in very minor things like eating something delicious jang said as for everything else in life things are unbearable tough and competitive and when they get out of university the patriarchal nature of south koreas working culture can be oppressive  everything celebrities do and say is revealed manipulated critiqued and sometimes    driven by identity politics    shown hate said jang  pandemic hits young women hard  now young people in south korea also confront the effects of covid  in the first half of  when the pandemic struck the country there was a  spike in young female suicides the societal consequences of the health crisis have weighed more heavily on young women here  south korea has fared relatively well economically since the onset of the pandemic with gdp declining by just  the modest decline was partly due to the nations export driven economy which offers little comfort to the hardships faced by those in low end temporary and service jobs predominantly women said jang  prior to the health emergency the youth jobless rate stood at about  now its roughly  say government statistics  strengthening suicide prevention is not enough argued jang the problems driving people to take their own lives here stem from deep rooted societal inequalities she said these require mid  to long term solutions  employment and economic support for youth in their s and s and much more support for young families with children

https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/oversight-of-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-7,"Good morning Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and members of the committee. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the FBI’s programs and priorities for the coming year. On behalf of the men and women of the FBI, let me begin by thanking you for your ongoing support of the Bureau. We pledge to be the best possible stewards of the authorities and the funding you have provided for us, and to use them to maximum effect to carry out our mission. Today’s FBI is a threat-focused, intelligence-driven organization. Each FBI employee understands that to defeat the key threats facing our nation, we must constantly strive to be more efficient and more effective. Just as our adversaries continue to evolve, so, too, must the FBI. We live in a time of acute and persistent terrorist and criminal threats to our national security, our economy, and our communities. These diverse threats underscore the complexity and breadth of the FBI’s mission. We remain focused on defending the United States against terrorism, foreign intelligence, and cyber threats; upholding and enforcing the criminal laws of the United States; protecting privacy, civil rights and civil liberties; and providing leadership and criminal justice services to federal, state, municipal, and international agencies and partners. Our continued ability to carry out this demanding mission reflects the support and oversight provided by this committee. National Security Counterterrorism Counterterrorism remains the FBI’s top priority; however, the threat has changed in two significant ways. First, the core al Qaeda tumor has been reduced, but the cancer has metastasized. The progeny of al Qaeda—including AQAP, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)—have become our focus. Second, we are confronting the explosion of terrorist propaganda and training on the Internet. It is no longer necessary to get a terrorist operative into the United States to recruit. Terrorists, in ungoverned spaces, disseminate poisonous propaganda and training materials to attract troubled souls around the world to their cause. They encourage these individuals to travel, but if they cannot travel, they motivate them to act at home. This is a significant change from a decade ago. We continue to identify individuals who seek to join the ranks of foreign fighters traveling in support of ISIL, and also homegrown violent extremists who may aspire to attack the United States from within. These threats remain among the highest priorities for the FBI and the Intelligence Community as a whole. Conflicts in Syria and Iraq continue to serve as the most attractive overseas theaters for Western-based extremists who want to engage in violence. We estimate approximately 250 Americans have traveled or attempted to travel to Syria to participate in the conflict. While this number is lower in comparison to many of our international partners, we closely analyze and assess the influence groups like ISIL have on persons located in the United States who are inspired to commit acts of violence. Whether or not the individuals are affiliated with a foreign terrorist organization and are willing to travel abroad to fight or are inspired by the call to arms to act in their communities, they potentially pose a significant threat to the safety of the United States and our citizens. ISIL has proven relentless in its violent campaign to rule and has aggressively promoted its hateful message, attracting like-minded extremists to include Westerners. To an even greater degree than al Qaeda or other foreign terrorist organizations, ISIL has persistently used the Internet to communicate, and its widespread reach through the Internet and social media is most concerning. ISIL blends traditional media platforms, glossy photos, in-depth articles, and social media campaigns that can go viral in a matter of seconds. No matter the format, the message of radicalization spreads faster than we imagined just a few years ago. Unlike other groups, ISIL has constructed a narrative that touches on all facets of life—from career opportunities to family life to a sense of community. The message isn’t tailored solely to those who are overtly expressing symptoms of radicalization. It is also seen by many who click through the Internet every day, receive social media push notifications, and participate in social networks. Ultimately, many of these individuals are seeking a sense of belonging. There is no set profile for the susceptible consumer of this propaganda. However, one trend continues to rise—the inspired youth. We’ve seen certain children and young adults drawing deeper into the ISIL narrative. These individuals are often comfortable with virtual communication platforms, specifically social media networks. ISIL continues to disseminate their terrorist message to all social media users—regardless of age. Following other groups, ISIL has advocated for lone offender attacks. In recent months, ISIL released a video, via social media, reiterating the group’s encouragement of lone offender attacks in Western countries, specifically calling for attacks against soldiers and law enforcement, intelligence community members, and government personnel. Several incidents in the United States and Europe over the last few months indicate this “call to arms” has resonated among ISIL supporters and sympathizers. The targeting of American military personnel is also evident with the release of names of individuals serving in the U.S. military by ISIL supporters. The names continue to be posted to the Internet and quickly spread through social media, demonstrating ISIL’s capability to produce viral messaging. Threats to U.S. military and coalition forces continue today. Social media also helps groups such as ISIL to spot and assess potential recruits. With the widespread horizontal distribution of social media, terrorists can identify vulnerable persons of all ages in the United States—spot, assess, recruit, and radicalize—either to travel or to conduct a homeland attack. The foreign terrorist now has direct access into the United States like never before. The FBI is using all lawful investigative techniques and methods to combat these terrorist threats to the United States. Along with our domestic and foreign partners, we are collecting and analyzing intelligence about the ongoing threat posed by foreign terrorist organizations and homegrown violent extremists. We continue to encourage information sharing; in partnership with our many federal, state, and local agencies assigned to Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country, we remain vigilant to ensure the safety of the American public. Be assured, the FBI continues to strive to work and share information more efficiently, and to pursue technological and other methods to help stay ahead of threats to the homeland.",FALSE,FALSE
https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/02/18/how-covid-19-coronavirus-is-uncovering-anti-asian-racism/,the covid  coronavirus outbreak has led to a surge of bullying and harassment of people of asian   descent photo getty getty  viruses dont tend to discriminate against people of certain racial backgrounds but people obviously can just look at the outbreaks of anti asian bullying and harassment that have occurred since the continuing new coronavirus  ncov outbreak emerged  for example in californias san fernando valley high schoolers physically assaulted a  year old boy and accused him of carrying the new coronavirus as christina capatides reported for cbs news  why did they do that  did the bullies test him with a centers for disease control and prevention cdc  novel coronavirus  ncov real time reverse transcriptase rt pcr diagnostic panel nope high school bullies running around with a diagnostic test kit would probably be a first did they check him for symptoms nope this wasnt a gang of doctors did they do a chest x ray nope apparently their main and only diagnostic criteria was that hes asian american meaning that hes an american who happens to be of asian descent his being all asian like and everything earned him the attack that landed him in the emergency room where he ended up getting an mri oh and by the way he didnt have a  ncov infection not even close  heres what cbs news had to say about the case  even though the  ncov outbreak arose specifically from wuhan china and has infected only a very very very very very times a thousand small percentage of those who are ethnically chinese bullies dont seem to be distinguishing among those of chinese descent in fact a number of bullies dont even seem to be distinguishing among different people of east asian descent lumping together those of chinese descent taiwanese descent korean descent japanese decent etc as suggested by artcrunchy here  thats not egg sellent at all all people of east asian descent do not look alike if you actually take the time to look in fact all people of chinese descent do not look alike but not lumping people together has never really been the hallmark of bigotry  this strain of coronavirus may be new but anti asian sentiment certainly isnt its not as if becoming racist is one of the symptoms of the  ncov outbreak or a public health measure at least it shouldnt be a normal reaction but more on this later instead racism is kind of like bad body odor people can hide both for a while with some political correctness or some deodorant however these things only cover up racism or body odor and never really gets rid of either  when anti asian attitudes remain it can only take a little event such as a politicians rhetoric a stressful situation or even just a tv show to bring bullying and harassment back out into the open as they say you see peoples true natures under times of duress case in point as deanna pan described for the boston globe fourteen year olds kathleen chen and helen deng freshmen at roxbury high school had already been enduring racist jokes and suspicious stares before  ncov hit the news the outbreak simply has meant that theyve had to endure even more of this bad treatment than usual wonderful stuff to have to experience during your formative years  high school students kathleen chen left and helen deng both freshmen at a roxbury high school   say theyve endured even more cruel jokes and suspicious stares than usual as fears of coronavirus mount so too has anti chinese racism around the globe photo by craig f walkerthe boston globe via getty images boston globe via getty images  this hasnt just been a kids will be kids thing plenty of adults have gotten into the act since  ncov hit the news the los angeles times article that senator kamala harris d california tweeted out below had a number of examples  an employee of asian descent getting dirty looks at a retail store someone writing on snapchat taking calc  with only asians in the classroom  i hope i dont catch coronavirus  thinkin about dropping this class now yep these are just a few examples of the type of behavior that has prompted nancy messonnier md director of the centers for disease control and prevention cdc national center for immunization and respiratory diseases to say do not assume that if someone is of asian descent they have coronavirus imagine someone having to say do not assume that if someone is of european descent or if someone is a woman or if someone has blonde hair that they have such and such virus  you know that such unfounded fears are strong when people are willing to turn down business just to avoid those of east asian descent thats exactly what some uber and lyft drivers have been doing when refusing to give rides to people who look asian or have asian sounding last names as detailed by christina farr for cnbc wonder what they would do if they ever got a request from senator mike lee r utah or the wu tang clan for a ride  not surprisingly social media has had its share of coronavirus asian jokes and memes such as warning the background music does use some expletives  the reaction to the tiktok video did prompt an explanation of sorts from the person who posted the video  the following tweet indicated that even a uk soccer star participated in the lets post a funny video game but later apologized for doing so  talk about putting a football in your mouth  reporter bethany ao lamented for the philadelphia inquirer ive watched anti asian sentiment spike as china fought to contain the coronavirus its disheartening to say the least ive watched my asian american friends share stories on twitter and facebook about how people stare at them in public  the experiences of asian americans have even helped spark a social media hashtag coughingwhileasian which has allowed people to share their stories such as  and the following video  individuals arent the only ones being targeted as described by andrew hay and maria caspani for reuters a flyer being circulated in los angeles carson area told people to avoid asian american run businesses due to concerns of  ncov and even included a fake world health organization who seal uh who would do that certainly not the who the following tweet showed the flyer  as people described jeff lewis on an episode the siriusxm radio show jeff lewis live joked along with his guest interior designer megan weaver about isolating asian american siriusxm employees refusing calls from asian listeners boycotting eateries like panda express and chin chin and avoiding trips to areas with asian communities or associations are your sirius lewis subsequently apologized we love our asian listeners and we would never want them to feel excluded we also never meant to spread hate or breed racism with our comments thats a funny way of showing love to asian listeners with funny in this case not being ha ha funny  speaking of love the graffiti on an asian restaurant in paris seen on this tweet did not quite show much of it  stay classy paris  speaking of france the le courier picard a local french newspaper which has nothing to do with commander picard of star trek decided to put some color in their headlines and writing but not in a good way as the following tweet showed the newspaper used words such as alerte jaune which translates to yellow alert and le peril jaune which translates to yellow peril  first of all people in china do not look like sponge bob squarepants they are not really yellow secondly the term yellow peril historically has very negative connotations if someone calls you the yellow peril you may not want to high five him or her just look at the definition of this term offered by dictionarycom in historical contexts the alleged danger that predominantly white western civilizations and populations could be overwhelmed by asian peoples in fact the entry labels this terms as disparaging and offensive which doesnt exactly scream out use this in a newspaper headline  if you happen to be feeling xenophobic today you know as opposed to the other day when you had a touch of misogyny or yesterday when you had a bout of homophobia dont worry a university of california berkeley instagram account posted a list of common reactions to the  ncov outbreak that included difficulty concentrating and sleeping and xenophobia yep take a look at this tweet which included the now deleted instagram post  yes thats right xenophobia is listed as a common reaction not something wrong not something thats an inappropriate way of thinking but something lumped together with being worried and having difficulty sleeping maybe a nice pumpkin spice latte may help your xenophobia not show so much the backlash to the instagram post did prompt an apology sort of  of course attempts to avoid people of chinese descent will not reduce your risk of getting infected by  ncov the virus itself is quite equal opportunity infecting anyone who happens to be close by and can be infected of course you do have to have lungs and a respiratory tract so if you are one of those lung less and respiratory tract less people then maybe you have a legitimate gripe about people with lungs otherwise there is no indication that the virus selectively targets anyone of any particular sociodemographic group once the virus has reached your location and is spreading anyone there can be carrying the virus  moreover the overwhelming majority of those of asian descent have not been anywhere near wuhan and the number of  ncov cases outside of china still remains relatively low as of february  the cdc lists only  confirmed cases of covid  in the united states the uk has had even fewer cases nine according to a bbc report from february  this relatively low number in the uk prompted comedian ken cheng to the following to put things in perspective  if you havent figured it out yet there arent exactly an overwhelming number of chinese people on television doing comedy there are probably more chinese people in jokes than telling jokes also keep in mind not everyone who has lived in or visited the hubei province in china is of asian descent  if you really want to avoid catching the virus or any respiratory virus like the flu for that matter keep your distance from anyone who is coughing regardless of that persons race or appearance in other words there should be a coughingwhilehuman or coughingwithlungs hashtag of course if someone is wearing a shirt that says i am from wuhan china am sick and may have caught the new coronavirus then maybe you should beware either way washing your hands frequently and thoroughly is probably the best thing that you can do  this certainly isnt the first time the spread of a disease has uncovered bigotry again the key word here is uncovered as opposed to led to or created the  ncov outbreak has essentially highlighted many of the stereotypes and challenges that those of east asian descent face even when there is no public health emergency for example this seems to be yet another case of asian americans being lumped together into one indistinguishable mass despite having remarkably diverse appearances abilities backgrounds and personalities how many havent heard something like oh theres jim bob and that asian guy over there asian americans certainly arent new to being bullied and harassed frequently facing these while growing up as described in a review article in the international journal of bullying prevention and in workplaces as described in a nbc news article and of course all of this is a reminder that no matter how long you have lived in the us even if you were born in the us no matter what you have done for the country a number of people may always view you as a foreigner and not ever really belonging here just because of the way you look  update an earlier version of the reuters article from andrew hay and maria caspani had indicated that the flyer circulated in los angeles carson area had included panda express however this story has been updated as such the story corrects to remove panda express from first paragraph after los angeles county official clarified that it was not mentioned in flyer,TRUE,TRUE
https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2016/10/15/kazuhiko-torishima-on-shaping-the-success-of-dragon-ball-and-the-origins-of-dragon-quest/,one of the major figures in manga and gaming in japan is that of kazuhiko torishima originally an editor on weekly shonen jump overseeing titles such as dr slump and dragon ball he also had a major hand in the creation of gaming series like dragon quest i was lucky enough to catch up with him recently and find out more about the work hes done over the years  these days torishima is president of the publisher hakusensha having taken up that role in  and its here where i managed to sit down and talk with him about his life and work  i was born in niigata in a city called ojiya and its population is only fifty thousand or so that meant right from starting at kindergarten to graduating from high school all your classmates are the same so a very small community  what happens when you grow up in a situation like that is that you end up disliking those kinds of small communities so i dont really enjoy going back to my home town its quite stifling nothing really seems to change not to mention that dealing with people there is incredibly complicated as you have to be super aware of everything you do or say  so when you dont have the financial background to escape that kind of community your only option is read a lot of books as they allow you to escape into a different world so reading a lot helped me to survive until i came to tokyo  i was curious how his fascination with reading developed into his role as a manga editor but as he explains that wasnt what he really intended  when i was in the fourth grade of elementary school i was peeing in a urinal and there was a window right in front of me through that i could see the moon at that moment i had a thought that not only was i looking at the moon but that the moon was looking back at me a little boy peeing that made me feel quite small and had me question my place in the universe it was a big question about being human as well as about my existence these types of questions really captured my imagination more and more so that pushed me into reading philosophy specifically i ended up reading a lot of confucianism nietzsche and pascal so even when i was in elementary school i read very difficult books like these  i read a lot of philosophy but there are a great many talented minds throughout history and they all say often very different and contradictory things this got quite difficult so i stopped and went to erotic novels  as my home was not very rich i didnt have enough money to buy manga on my own that meant if i wanted some manga i had to ask my parents for it however during those days parents generally disapproved of that kind of thing that meant if i read something like books i could go to my local library sometimes if they had french literature you could also come by erotic novels so i ended up visiting a lot of different libraries and picked up all sorts of interesting books  the reason i originally wanted to join shueisha was because of the monthly magazine playboy which had just started a year before i joined the company in those days playboy was unique it had a lot of very high quality short stories and novellas by famous authors both in japan and abroad the first issue was also sold out in one day in japan so it was hugely popular so i wanted to join the playboy team and i had no idea that shueisha published so much manga this was back in  i think  after i got the job offer from shueisha they of course started to send their various publications to me for reference on receiving lots of large boxes i began to get a bad feeling when they only seemed to contain manga so that was the first real contact i had with manga  starting out at shueisha and learning about manga  considering his literary interests werent to do with manga torishima took an interesting approach to his situation instead of simply giving up he did his best to understand and especially analyze manga its this analytical approach that set him apart and helped him to ground him in his new role as he says so when i joined shueisha they decided that i should work on the weekly jump team but i didnt know what that meant as i didnt read manga this was a big shock as not only was i to work on manga but on a periodical i didnt know  naturally i started to read jump after i started as that was my team and my job but it wasnt fun at all as i was also a newbie to the team i had to write a daily report to my manager part of this was that i had to include my weekly ranking of the different manga within weekly jump picking out the ones i found most fun so i made that ranked list but weekly jump also does something similar by asking its readers to vote for their favorite series that would come two or three weeks later sadly for me the two lists were entirely different almost opposite in fact  faced with this i had to do something even if i read weekly jump i just didnt find it fun the drawings werent good and after reading jump your thumbs turned black because of the ink used however there were two things that changed me the first thing was that during those days i was in charge of a manga series called doberman deka which was illustrated by shinji hiramatsu it had already been decided that the manga would finish its run in a few months as it was doing very badly in the reader popularity rankings from my perspective though i thought hiramatsu was very good at drawing action scenes but he was really bad at drawing women they all looked the same he couldnt differentiate the characters since doberman deka was an original story it was decided to add a new character that would be a policewoman hiramatsu drew this new character but i didnt like it at all so i went out and bought a famous magazine called myojo this was a magazine all about actors and idols that magazine also had a separate issue that covered the ranking of idols at the time the number one idol then was sakakibara ikue while shes in her s now in those days she was very young and cute so i thought this type of face might become very popular in the near future and i asked hiramatsu to change the face of the new character to match this idol after this the ranking for doberman deka changed dramatically from around seventeenth place to third so these chain of events made me think that my job could actually be interesting  the second thing was that next to the shueisha building was the shogakukan office the owners of shueisha inside that building was a massive archive of everything they had ever published so all the manga and magazines from shueisha and shogakukan since i was a newbie on the team i had to come to work early however i was very quick at my job and once i finished my work some of the senior staff might ask me to do tasks for them i didnt like that at all so i always escaped from the office once my work was done and sneaked into the big archive in the shogakukan building there i started to read lots of classic manga and i found some really great works interestingly most of the manga i really enjoyed was meant for girls rather than boys my favorites at that time were probably kaze to ki no uta by keiko takemiya and poe no ichizoku by moto hagio as well as some works by mitsuru adachi reading all of these manga made me realize that in fact there were many great manga out there however the manga within weekly jump didnt match what i thought as being all that good i just didnt like the weekly jump manga but i now knew that there were lots of great manga outside of that  to explain the manga within weekly jump in those days had no intelligence or depth the quality of the drawing was also really bad  so these two things made me think that i should setup and help create manga that i thought could be interesting if those manga could win the reader ranking then everything would be okay  after all this i started to read a lot of manga as i now knew that there could be great manga outside of weekly jump the good thing was also that because i hadnt really read manga before it meant i could try everything so i had no preconceptions  after all this study and analysis torishima had a very important revelation about manga itself as he explains once id read a lot of manga i came to realize that there are two main types the first is easy to read and the other is hard to read to explain when its easy to read the pages just flow through your fingers when its harder you have to go back a few pages to check what was happening as such i discarded all the manga i thought that fell into the second harder to read category this only left the easy to read manga and the best one was ore wa teppei by tetsuya chiba  each weekly run of a manga is  pages so i picked up the first installment of ore wa teppei and analyzed it pane by pane and angle by angle trying to understand why this pane had to be this way or why chiba had chosen that angle i think i read that installment around fifty times  from this experience i understood how a page should be divided into panes and that this was the most important thing a manga had to get right in addition i learned how you did the layout within in each pane in order to make it easy to read in that sense i suppose i learned the rules behind what made the structure of a good manga work the result of all this was that i tried to apply what id learned to the manga authors i was working with  after this the manga authors became better and better very often the new authors would debut not in weekly jump but in a special issue and after they applied my techniques they would get a better place in the rankings  working with akira toriyama and the creation of dr slump and dragon ball  one of torishimas most famous editorial collaborations is with akira toriyama as toriyamas works went onto be hugely successful i wanted to know more about how torishima had guided the then new manga author  around that time i met and started working with akira toriyama so when he started he was obviously a newcomer as a manga author but i was also a relative newcomer as an editor as well while i felt i had a very good grasp and skill on pane layout wed often argue and there was a lot of trial and error  after  months of working together toriyama came up with the first draft of dr slump right after that toriyama moved his office he apparently found around  pages of manga that i had declined i think by the time of dr slump it was probably three years that toriyama had been working for shueisha  so to clarify during those years toriyama would come up with all sorts of things and i would just say no  the result of all this was that when dr slump debuted in weekly jump it started out nd in the reader rankings so it started very successfully  as the title says dr slump originally arale was not meant to be the main character she was just a guest character for episode one however i really loved the girl characters toriyama created so i wanted to use arale as the main character toriyama thought differently as weekly jump was meant for boys surely a girl could not be a protagonist so we made a gamble on making arale the main character  so i challenged toriyama to make one special issue with a girl as the protagonist and we made a bet on where it would come in the ranking the result of that being whoever got the closest to the final rank could have the final say naturally i won and i made arale the main character while i won the bet toriyama is quite stubborn and he refused to change the name of the manga from dr slump to something else so i compromised on that  however one of the more famous aspects to this collaboration on dr slump is that toriyama created the villain of dr mashirito this was meant to be torishima in fact as the name mashirito is a reversal of his name considering that the prior bet had resulted in arale becoming the protagonist of dr slump i wanted to know if that had catalyzed the creation of dr mashirito  as for dr mashirito that has nothing to do with this bet that came about because toriyama did a draft outline for a new story for a new episode in which a mad scientist would show up while the story was okay the character of the mad scientist was not strong enough i knew from doberman deka that the look of the character was very important so i told toriyama that the current mad scientist was too weak and he needed to go back and come up with someone really nasty with a big impact so i told him to imagine the person he hates the most and think of the nastiest person on the planet that he had to draw that with all his passion and emotion  so i waited and waited but i didnt receive the issue until the deadline which meant i didnt have any time to change it anyway toriyama had given the mad scientist my face and changed his name to dr mashirito which is my name backwards my reaction was okay he did it my only hope was that if the character was unpopular it would be a one off but unfortunately everyone loved it  this all became very famous very quickly because in those days after each episode there was a short manga and toriyama had already written about me in one of these before dr mashirito so everyone knew that dr mashirito was meant to be me  dr slump was a huge success but it wasnt long before toriyama wanted to try out something different as torishima explains while dr slump had started out very successfully after six months or so toriyama said he didnt want to continue that he wanted to stop the reason was because each story for dr slump was self contained and finished every week it was also a comedy as well this meant that if something didnt work toriyama invariably had to change everything so it was a heavy burden  naturally we werent able to stop dr slump as it was a top ranking manga in weekly jump and shueisha would want to keep that going i mean the manga would regularly sell  million copies and the anime adaptation was going to start on tv so we had to continue  however i spoke to the chief editor at weekly jump about all this his response was that if we could come up with something more interesting and successful than dr slump then sure do that instead  so both i and toriyama talked at great length about what we should do however before that we had to restructure the dr slump workflow meaning that each episode had to be done in  days rather than  leaving the last  for us to work on the new project  during these  days we started to work on the new project we talked a lot and had many meetings on what it should be when we started i thought because i was a successful manga editor and toriyama was a brilliant manga author that coming up with something new would be easy however we came up with lots of ideas but it was clear that none of them would be successful  after a while i thought that we couldnt continue this process forever so maybe wed only have one more meeting on this new project so i went to nagoya to meet toriyama but even after talking all day until the last shinkansen back to tokyo we couldnt come up with anything good  before i left toriyamas office his wife brought us some tea and she started to talk about how weird and unique her husband was toriyamas wife also used to be a manga author and she told me that its very common for manga authors to listen to the radio or music when they are drawing manga as their ears are free however toriyama was different as he liked to watch a recorded movie on tv while he worked i found this very interesting because to draw manga you need to concentrate and look at what you are drawing toriyamas wife said that even though her husband didnt watch the movie he could tell what was happening but if it was a part he was interested in he would lift his head and watch it i asked toriyama what he watched while drawing manga and he said mainly jackie chans kung fu movies i also asked whether he could tell what was going on just from the speech of the character and he said yeah ive watched these movies more than fifty times  so i said that if he liked kung fu movies so much why not try a kung fu action manga for the next project after this toriyama came up with a very short  page short story called dragon boy this one off short story then got an incredibly good ranking in weekly jump  this version of the story pre dates any of the elements from journey to the west and that was my idea that came later the biggest reason for that was it was a free intellectual property as it was very old in addition when you need to make a long running manga series you need to add a lot more features over something like the episodic dr slump so in journey to the west you have lots of gadgets like the pole staff and flying cloud so when we moved dragon boy to a long running story format thats when the journey to the west elements came in  one of the other big reasons i liked journey to the west as an influence was because with dr slump the story mainly happened on something like the west coast of the us as in the environment and overall setting however as we were trying to start something new i thought we needed an almost opposite setting in those days china was not a popular topic in manga and i thought that would make us stand out by being unique and fresh so we wanted to have the story operate in a very different world from that of dr slump so the opposite of california for me was something like china  i wanted to make the whole thing completely different in fact the opposite of dr slump the protagonist wouldnt be a girl but a boy move the setting from california to china change the focus from comedy to story  changing the focus of dragon ball and dealing with anime adaptations  with the move over to dragon ball the series evolved quite substantially over the course of its run however much of this was also linked into how the anime adaptations were planned out  the really important thing for boys manga is that you need to make the readers feel like they are connected to the protagonist there needs to be a very strong emotional connection from the reader to the protagonist that they see themselves as that character so if the protagonist in dragon ball was a monkey which was the original plan then no one could relate to that  originally we started dragon ball as a kind of road movie based upon journey to the west but the ranking started to gradually decline so we discussed about why this type of story wasnt resonating with readers and why we arent doing well in the rankings the conclusion we came to was that goku the protagonist was not strong enough that he didnt resonate with the readers very well from there we discussed a great deal about what goku should be like the answer was that goku wants to get stronger and stronger in order to pursue that theme we decided to forget all the previous characters except for goku and master roshi to strengthen this theme further we added a new character called krillin mainly focusing on three characters we made new episodes based around the training of goku in addition to show how goku became stronger we had a big tournament in the story after all this the ranking shot back up to the top again  even after the success of the first tournament in the story we both thought at that point that dragon ball was not a strong manga something was missing again we had lots of meetings and discussions we then realized that we didnt have a good villain somebody really evil which gives goku the motivation to defeat him as dragon ball had some legacy from dr slump the first part of the series was a bit comedic in tone that meant even the villains were perhaps too cute or funny so we needed strong villains to make goku more attractive to readers  from there we thought about what makes a good villain what would a really evil villain be like so i went through all the evil people i could think of from global history and introduced those to toriyama so each day id introduce a historical figure and explain how evil he was after around  or so people i got to the roman emperor nero it was said that nero took great pleasure is seeing other people suffer that explanation really hit home with toriyama and he understood that is what a villain would be that is evil from that piccolo was created  this was also the starting point for the future development of the dragon ball series including all the future alien elements  around this time we also had all the various anime adaptations of dr slump and dragon ball happening however from my perspective the dr slump anime was not successful this was because they couldnt make the anime as loyal to the original manga it deviated from the original manga a great deal the reason for this was because it was the first real time the weekly jump team had to manage an anime adaptation based on one of their manga series so nobody knew how to control the anime side of things or manage the creative process in that way as i struggled a lot with this kind of thing on dr slump i made a list of everything that went wrong and didnt work properly this motivated me to handle things very differently for dragon ball  much like the techniques i learned about how manga should be presented and how panes should be used i then tried to learn the best practice for anime not only for the creative aspect but also the business side as well i also talked to the team for doraemon at shogakukan about how they managed the business side and creative side so i tried to use all of this for dragon ball  the most important thing i learned is that you have to keep control in terms of decision making what went wrong with dr slump was that once something was done in the anime we wanted to change it however it was always too late as it had been already animated so for dragon ball we created a huge bible for the series including all the merchandising before even starting production on the anime we also were a lot more hands on as well and did our best to control the whole process  even though we tried to make the dragon ball anime better than dr slumps the ratings still went gradually down we then tried to figure out why that was happening why the series wasnt doing well one thing we discovered was that the producer for the dragon ball anime was the same as on dr slump as he had an image of toriyamas manga as being something cute and funny which meant his style of dragon ball became too similar to dr slump this meant he was missing the more serious tone we had developed in the dragon ball manga for instance when i saw the scene in the anime where goku pierces piccolo i realized i couldnt work with this producer  so i talked with the studio and asked to have the producer changed this was something that had never happened before as it was an entirely different company  around the same time saint seiya was a very popular anime this was interesting because the saint seiya manga was rather average but the anime by comparison was a lot better so i wanted to know why the saint seiya anime was doing so well and we did some research on that we found that there were two key figures the first was kouzou morishita who was the director and the second was takao koyama who wrote the script so i visited these two guys and asked them if theyd help me reboot dragon ball and they both agreed  in addition to all this toriyama was asking to change the character design for goku from the cuter proportions to something taller and more muscular when i heard this for the first time i argued a lot with him about it this was because i thought the most important thing with boys comics was to have the main character resonate with the readers so if you switched the characters proportions then that would be an all new character to the readers my first reaction to all this was to say no to changing goku but toriyamas explanation was very logical and the only option was for me to agree that explanation was that since the battles were becoming increasingly serious in the manga and you had a proper villain in the form of piccolo who was taller than goku all this meant that if had to draw a serious battle you needed to show gokus muscles as well as strong actions for his punching and kicking so in order to draw these kinds of actions in this context it meant that goku needed to have taller proportions and more muscles this was also something that toriyama had to do anyway in previous episodes of the manga as he would be forced to distort the proportions of goku to make the fights work what was more after each battle goku would return to his cuter smaller form these kinds of discrepancies really annoyed toriyama so his response was simply that i would approve these changes to goku or that he would stop making dragon ball  all of this was great timing as we had all these staff changes happening in the animation as well the new anime producer also was very smart and said that if we had a new title in that dragon ball would finish and wed start a new show then that meant the anime would get more money for promotion so we decided to go with the different title and updated characters with bigger proportions and we had a meeting for this new title but we couldnt come up with anything good i went and asked toriyama for his input and he answered immediately by saying dragon ball z i asked why z and he said because this is last nothing comes after this  as we all know dragon ball z was not the last installment in the series but its interesting to know that was toriyamas intent at least  famicon shinken and the origins of dragon quest  considering that toriyama was very involved with games like dragon quest i wanted to know whether torishima had anything to do with that it turned out that his role was very much an integral one  i was deeply involved in the start of dragon quest along with shueisha obviously the scenario writer yuji horii also started as a writer on weekly jump he was introduced to me by another writer akira sakuma who had done momotaro densetsu and both of these were at weekly jump at one time i was introduced because people knew i liked to play games in the arcades and i was told that horii really liked games in terms of the games i used to play in the arcades i loved xevious  one day weekly jump had a prize for readers which was one of nintendos game  watch handhelds as it was known that i was a big fan of games this job to manage this fell to me however i thought it wasnt fun to just give prizes to readers we should make some special pages within weekly jump about games i thought maybe horii can help me so this was how the game related pages started within weekly jump  we started these gaming pages within weekly jump and for a while we featured pc games but in those days pcs were incredibly expensive to own so this type of hardware was out of reach to most of the young weekly jump readers this forced us to shift our focus over to nintendos family computer or famicom and the msx we did these kinds of feature pages for a while but we they didnt do too well and we thought about bringing it to an end  right after we finished those initial gaming pages in weekly jump my manager came up to me with a recent copy of corocoro comics and told me that they were doing really well the reason behind this was that they had special pages that were sealed together that you couldnt read in the store you had to buy your copy and then cut open these special pages at home it seem that these special sealed pages were the key to this success and i was asked to investigate more and find out what was written on these sealed pages  we did the research on corocoro comics and found that the contents of these sealed pages were cheats or special techniques for games at that point i instantly knew what was the cause of their success  as a result we tried something similar in weekly jump and because we sold more it meant we had more money that meant we could go with having four colors on these special pages whereas corocoro comics could only do two colors so in addition to this increase in colors we also decided to rate the games  back in those days no one was ranking games like this but considering that most games were quite expensive for kids this meant everyone wanted to know which were the good or bad games all of this was before famitsu obviously around   these new sealed gaming pages then jumped to the rd place in the weekly jump reader rankings  as a result i told my manager that we were going to go with gaming cheats and reviews for these special pages but i warned him that gaming companies would come to shueisha to complain to try and shut us down from disclosing cheats as well as reviewing their games so i told him that we had to be protected in order to do this that the gaming companies couldnt get involved in what we did thankfully my manager promised to protect us so we went ahead  as i expected lots of gaming companies like hudson konami and namco came to complain to shueisha they argued that divulging cheats and reviewing games was a violation of their intellectual property wed already talked to our lawyers at shueisha and their position was that because each game was sold publicly that meant shueisha had purchased the game and that we were merely referencing on what we had already purchased so that could not be a violation of intellectual property  as these kinds of gaming companies would always try to hide things from their customers they couldnt be very strong against a company as large as shueisha  this was the birth of famicom shinken a hugely famous gaming resource in japan and one that laid the groundwork of much that would follow torishimas concern about gaming companies interfering was a prescient one and sadly something that still plagues the mainstream gaming press all over the world today  the name for the gaming section in weekly jump was interesting as it came from the very successful manga fist of the north star the term shinken was used to describe the type of martial art kenshiro used in the manga that of hokuto shinken the meaning here was that this gaming section in weekly jump would give players the gaming sweetspot on how to conquer each game this was also shown by having the characters in famicom shinken dressed in fist of the north star clothes and pointing at the reader much like how kenshiro attacked an opponents pressure points  the game rankings also werent done with straight up scores either but instead with an amount of atatatatata which was a reference to the famous hokuto hyakuretsu ken attack that kenshiro used in the manga and anime  after we started our sealed gaming pages it wasnt long until magazines like famitsu popped up however our gaming section was focused on cheats and was only done by two or three people on top of that we used to get around thirty thousand letters from our readers about gaming compared to famitsu who even tried to reverse engineer the famicom cartridges we realized we had reached our limit on what we could do  we then came up with a new idea as our current structure had reached its limit so the idea was to show to our readers how a game is developed starting from the very early concept stages all the way through production as it would be our own game the information would then be exclusive so this is how dragon quest started  at this time horii started his work at enix on games like portopia renzoku satsujin jiken and okhotsku ni kiyu hokkaido rensa satsujin jiken in addition myself and my team were crazy about role playing games on apple like ultima so i thought we should do a role playing game with horii as the scenario writer however if we had just these things it would mean we wouldnt have the justification to include it in weekly jump this is why i decided to add toriyama to the project for the character designs  in terms of the games development enix paid for all of it shueisha didnt invest in addition shueisha would not own the intellectual property that was something i intentionally did the main reason for this was that my manager then didnt understand games that meant if shueisha was involved in the intellectual property side of things then all the decisions would have had to go through my manager so i intentionally separated the project from shueisha so to protect the game from getting ruined  all this meant we had exclusive coverage for dragon quest in weekly jump and another thing that helped convince my manager was that we could publish a book about the game due to our deal on the game it also meant we didnt have to pay any royalties to enix on that whatsoever  around this time i was only an editor not an editor in chief or a manager what i wanted to avoid was to have shueisha involved in the project as it would drastically slow the games production down as each decision would need external approval that meant i had to give shueisha some benefit elsewhere such as exclusive content and no need to pay royalties with the latter allowing us to do a manga on the game if we wanted  torishima is still a keen and active gamer though and was happy to talk about the games he loved as well as those he currently plays  in terms of games i really loved i suppose wizardry and ultima i love to play games even now i dont read manga outside the office but at home i still play games these days i play on my smartphone things like terra battle and lord of the dragons in terms of console games i play things like odin sphere and dark souls iii on ps  at this years tokyo game show i also had a go on playstation vr and played summer lesson which was a unique experience for me as a result i went to visit bandai namco to meet katsuhiro harada  defending the integrity of manga and the secrets of good editorial  more recently torishima got involved in fighting against a tokyo governmental bill that would have seriously hampered the creative expression of both manga and anime  in regards to bill  i saw two major problems with it the first was that a political body was trying to decide the direction of creative expression the second part was that in the bill the tokyo government tried to specifically discriminate against manga and anime while ignoring content from movies or novels in that these new restrictions will be only applied to manga and anime whereas with movies and novels they could do whatever they liked in short the government saw manga and anime as something lower than other media and that is not good  these days the tokyo government encourages tourists to visit the city to see things to do with manga and anime because their want the sightseeing revenue so they did events like the tokyo anime fair which is now animejapan whereas the then governor of tokyo shintaro ishihara was trying to unfairly discriminate anime or manga against movies or novels so these two things obviously conflicted and as such i tried to fight against that  the problem i saw was that the mayor ishihara was a novel author himself in that sense he probably thought from his perspective that manga and anime is beneath him something just for kids so they might be able to use it sightseeing resources but he clearly didnt see manga or anime as a tool of creative expression whereas to me it should be treated the same as with novels or movies  now that ishihara is no longer the governor and the tokyo government has withdrawn from things like the tokyo anime fair now that event animejapan is run by the animation industry directly so i think everything is much healthier now in a much better position  as for the new governor and her plan to turn tokyo into an anime land i dont like to get involved with politics if i can help it  with that behind him torishima is looking to the future and how he can best pass on the knowledge and expertise he has learned  these days i am the president of hakusensha my term is for two and a half years during my time here i want to foster the young editors and as such i am conducting meetings with them for each session there are four young editors and myself within that time they have to talk and about two subjects what would i do if i was the president of hakusensha and what would i do if i was the editor in chief so they pick one and talk freely about it the reason behind this is that because of company culture people arent really trained to listen to what their counterpart says and also to speak out when you feel something isnt right its very hierarchical so these kinds of debates arent something most people are trained for here however these skills are absolutely critical in becoming an editor as they have to talk to and often argue at length with manga authors so this is why i want to foster these young editors while i am at hakusensha if i can foster just one good editor then they can manage at least ten good manga authors in the future so its important i think  recently kentaro miura got in contact with me on doing an interview about berserk so i sat down and read the whole series to prepare for that what i told him in that interview is that if he had met me much earlier berserk could have been much better and probably finished by now with you working on something new instead  with all the work i have done i only really think about the japanese market and audience so ive never really paid much attention to what was happening outside of japan things like dragon ball happened to be popular outside of japan and resonate with an international audience one thing i learned from that is if you work hard on making something great for one place it tends to work globally a good example is that with japanese food like sushi or ramen is that we developed that for our tastes yet it still works for almost everyone in the world so long as you have the core part the essential part really good then it will work everywhere  the important and most difficult thing about being an editor of manga is you have to organize and cut something from the work of a talented manga author you are there to make their talent and ability become elevated to a newer and higher level its like cutting a diamond you obviously need good raw material but if you dont cut it into a brilliant shape it will never shine  on figuring out which ones are the plain rocks or the diamonds you need to cut  being able to talk with torishima on all the things he did from being a manga editor to effectively starting the japanese gaming press as well as the creation of dragon quest was utterly fascinating  his calm analytical approach was something i wish was more prevalent within creative circles far too often are decisions made on emotional belief than on the reality of a situation  while its sad to think that in a few years he will retire from hakusensha i only hope he manages to foster younger editors to follow in his analytical footsteps  in any case its clear that without torishima the world of manga anime and games would likely be a very different as well as a duller place  follow me on twitter

https://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/rochelle-riley/2016/02/06/dr-mona-hanna-attisha-goes-doctor-global-hero/79772514/,"FLINT — The night before her scheduled appearance on national TV to talk about the Flint water crisis, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha walked into the Oakland County home she shares with her husband and two daughters and plopped onto the couch. She wanted to listen to an NPR interview (the first of herself she would watch or hear). But her 7-year-old daughter “began screaming ‘No more Flint!’ and took the phone and threw it across the room,” she said with a laugh. Yep, if Lady Gaga were saving lives, imagine the chaos. That is how overwhelming life has become for the 39-year-old Flint pediatrician turned whistle-blower who forced the state to concede that thousands of Flint residents had been exposed to lead-poisoned water for months. Hanna-Attisha works with children. She knows that adults sometime have the same attention span, so she said she is compelled to speak out while Flint has the world’s attention. Her passionate, candid comments and her willingness to tell the truth have helped her achieve rock star status. Like the ubiquitous Dr. Phil, she is now universally referred to as Dr. Mona.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-authorized-soleimani-s-killing-7-months-ago-conditions-n1113271,washington    president donald trump authorized the killing of iranian gen qassem soleimani seven months ago if irans increased aggression resulted in the death of an american according to five current and former senior administration officials  the presidential directive in june came with the condition that trump would have final signoff on any specific operation to kill soleimani officials said  that decision explains why assassinating soleimani was on the menu of options that the military presented to trump two weeks ago for responding to an attack by iranian proxies in iraq in which a us contractor was killed and four us service members were wounded the officials said  the timing however could undermine the trump administrations stated justification for ordering the us drone strike that killed soleimani in baghdad on jan  officials have said soleimani the leader of the islamic revolutionary guard corps elite quds force was planning imminent attacks on americans and had to be stopped  there have been a number of options presented to the president over the course of time a senior administration official said adding that it was some time ago that the presidents aides put assassinating soleimani on the list of potential responses to iranian aggression  after iran shot down a us drone in june john bolton trumps national security adviser at the time urged trump to retaliate by signing off on an operation to kill soleimani officials said secretary of state mike pompeo also wanted trump to authorize the assassination officials said  but trump rejected the idea saying hed take that step only if iran crossed his red line killing an american the presidents message was thats only on the table if they hit americans according to a person briefed on the discussion  neither the white house nor the national security council responded to requests for comment bolton and the state department also did not respond to requests for comment  us intelligence officials have closely tracked soleimanis movements for years when trump came into office pompeo who was trumps first cia director urged the president to consider taking a more aggressive approach to soleimani after showing him new intelligence on what a second senior administration official described as very serious threats that didnt come to fruition  download the nbc news app for breaking news and politics  the idea of killing soleimani came up in discussions in  that trumps national security adviser at the time retired army lt gen hr mcmaster was having with other administration officials about the presidents broader national security strategy officials said but it was just one of a host of possible elements of trumps maximum pressure campaign against iran and was not something that was thought of as a first move said a former senior administration official involved in the discussions  the idea did become more serious after mcmaster was replaced in april  by bolton a longtime iran hawk and advocate for regime change in tehran bolton left the white house in september    he said he resigned while trump said he fired him    following policy disagreements on iran and other issues  john bolton then the national security adviser listens as president donald trump meets with netherlands prime minister mark rutte at the white house on july   jabin botsford  the washington postgetty images file  the administration of president george w bush designated the quds force a foreign terrorist organization in  four years later the obama administration announced new sanctions on soleimani and three other senior quds force officials in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate the saudi ambassador to the united states  but in april bolton helped prod trump to designate the entire islamic revolutionary guard corps a foreign terrorist organization white house officials at the time refused to say whether that meant the united states would target revolutionary guard leaders as it does the leadership of other terrorist groups such as the islamic state militant group and al qaeda  iran retaliated by designating the us military a terrorist organization  the actions underscored the rising tension between the united states and iran in the three years since trump took office  get full coverage of the iran crisis  since trump withdrew the united states from the iran nuclear deal in     and his administration tightened its squeeze on irans economy with punishing economic sanctions    iran has attacked us military assets in iraq with increasing aggressiveness and frequency  iran has launched more than a dozen separate rocket attacks on bases housing americans since october the us military blamed kataib hezbollah an iraqi militia that is part of the popular mobilization forces but is backed by iran us military and intelligence officials say the group takes direction from iran specifically the quds force  a us military official in iraq said the rockets iran has launched at us forces have become more sophisticated over time  most attacks in october and november used mm rockets which have a shorter range and less explosive power but an attack on ain al asad air base in anbar province on dec  included mm rockets with more firepower and the ability to be fired from a greater distance they are generally launched from more sophisticated improvised rail systems leading the us military to believe the attackers were receiving new equipment and training from iran  the largest attack was on dec  when kataib hezbollah launched more than  rockets at an iraqi base in kirkuk killing a us contractor and wounding four us service members  the base known as k  air base belongs to the iraqi military but frequently hosts forces that are part of the us led coalition assigned to operation inherent resolve the fight against isis on dec  the coalition was preparing for a counter isis operation so more americans were on the base than usual  after the attack the united states launched airstrikes against five kataib hezbollah locations three in iraq and two in syria targeting ammunition and weapon supplies as well as command and control sites  trump signed off on the operation to kill soleimani after iranian backed militia members responded to the us strikes by storming the us embassy compound in baghdad  defense secretary mark esper presented a series of response options to the president two weeks ago including killing soleimani esper presented the pros and cons of such an operation but made it clear that he was in favor of taking out soleimani officials said  at a meeting later military leaders laid out the estimated number of casualties associated with each option showing the president that killing soleimani at imam khomeini international airport late at night would involve fewer possible casualties than the other options  the strike marked a break from past administrations which have never publicly claimed responsibility for killing senior figures from the iranian regime or its proxies  during the height of the us war in iraq in  for example when iranian armed and  trained militias were planting lethal roadside bombs targeting us troops bush administration officials debated how to confront soleimani and his operatives in iraq according to four former us officials us troops captured revolutionary guard operatives but never tried to kill soleimani or launch attacks inside iranian territory former officials said  at one point the us commander in iraq army gen george casey raised the possibility of designating soleimani and his quds force officers as enemy combatants in iraq according to eric edelman a former diplomat who held senior posts at the defense department and the white house but in the end the idea was ruled out as us commanders and officials did not want to open up a new front in iraq when us forces were preoccupied with the fight against al qaeda in iraq edelman said  there were a lot of us who thought he should be taken out but at the end of the day they decided not to do that edelman said there was concern about the danger of escalation and the danger of having a conflict with iran while we already had our hands full in iraq he said  iran responded to the assassination of soleimani by striking bases housing us forces in iraq and after no americans were killed trump appeared to back off further military conflict instead he announced new sanctions against iran on friday,FALSE,FALSE

https://www.newsweek.com/eight-good-reasons-we-all-including-trump-should-fear-putin-711409,this article first appeared on the history news network  donald trump stunned the  branches of his own countrys intelligence community including the cia which is run by his appointee as is the fbi when he declared he did not believe their unanimous finding that russia interfered in the  presidential election and subverted our democracy  his colonel klinkesque inability to see anything in regards to the nefarious intent of the former ex kgb ruler and to trust him at his word instead of the word of thousands of employees his countrys intelligence services who have created a report systematically outlining russias cyber attack on the election stem to a large extent from his unwillingness to attribute any of his election success to this massive interference  it could potentially stem from the fact that he is susceptible to blackmail of the sort described in the steele dossier or from the complex web of his financial dealings with russia and he may also naively believe he can cut a deal with the russian autocrat  but trumps willingness to publicly refute the findings of his own countrys intelligence agencies may also stem from his complete ignorance of putins record of genocide in his own country overthrowing democracy in russia wiping out civilian packed cities in muslim lands threatening nato allies killing opponents abroad being a leader of the worlds most notorious secret police lying to his own people to lead them to war and fighting cia assets in a genocidal war in syria  a brief foray into the history of putins brazen challenges to nato defeat of us backed rebels in syria violations of internationally recognized norms crimes against humanity in areas ranging from the deserts of war torn aleppo to the war blackened villages of the tiny republic of chechnya and assault on democracy in our country and his own country clearly demonstrates how vast the chasm is between our two countries guiding principles  it also clearly demonstrates why trump should not construct a parallel universe where putin is somehow a friend of our country or its founding principles which the president is sworn to defend  while some of the vast differences between americas founding principles and those of putin have become obvious since russias recent unprovoked cyber subversion of the democratic process in the november  us elections much of it has been swept under the rug or just plain forgotten  a brief refresher on the true nature of putin provides a stark lesson on just how deluded trump is in his quixotic quest to erase the brutal past prevent congress from sanctioning putin and somehow win over a man who has been dedicated to undermining american influence for decades  below are eight reasons why trump and every american should fear russia and its autocratic leader they are also reasons why the us should continue to punish putin through crippling and punitive sanctions of the very sort congress recently passed in a veto proof bill designed to defeat the american presidents bizarre efforts to halt both republicans and democrats from punishing the russians for their recent cyber assault   putin was a member of the notorious kgb which is not the same thing as the cia  while some have forgotten just what an evil the kgb secret police or committee for state security was or have tried to relativize and claim that the cia is and was the same thing as the kgb the truth is that the kgb was responsible for the death and imprisonment of millions the kgb it should be recalled ran the trans eurasian prison camp system known as the gulag located primarily in the frozen wastes of siberia  millions of soviet citizens from targeted classes such as kulaks wealthy peasants practicing christians wealthy individuals described as bourgeois parasites subversive dissidents and capitalist jews were rounded up sent to the gulag or state prison system or executed by the kgb  in addition members of the so called punished nations ie members of targeted minorities such as the chechens crimean tatars volga germans kalmyk mongols etc were deported en masse on kgb cattle trains that the survivors called crematoria on wheels to siberia in what is today called ethnic cleansing where they died off in the hundreds of thousands in a hidden genocide  it takes a special person to join an organization that carried out all the above crimes spies on its own citizens keeps them in thrall and is dedicated to defeating western democracy and capitalism  the kgb also ran the borders of the soviet state and prevented its citizens from fleeing the ussr putin served in the kgb and openly mourned the  collapse of what ronald reagan called the evil empire  putins mindset and worldview are irrevocably shaped by his decades spent as a member of a vast army of police who spied on their own people arrested them tortured them and killed them by the millions over the course of  years through forced famines execution ethnic cleansing or death by prison camp  and the kgb is far from dead under putin most recently in  it is widely accepted that the fsb the new iteration of the dreaded kgb for example administered dioxin poison to the pro western democratically elected president of the ukraine victor yushchenko and horribly scarred his face to punish him for his outreach to america and europe  but yushchenko was far luckier than russian dissident alexander litvenko who was killed by a dose of radioactive polonium  administered by an fsb agent in london where he had found asylum this incident caused a diplomatic spat between london and moscow and shows that putin has no respect for the sovereignty of key american allies like the british  other russian opposition leaders and dissidents have been killed by the fsb in areas ranging from qatar to austria as a means of silencing their voices to compound matters the pentagon has recently come to the conclusion that the fsb and gru russian military intelligence have been shipping weapons to taliban insurgents in northern afghanistan at a time when trump has doubled down on trying to suppress the taliban insurgency   putin rose to power on a lie  under president boris yeltsin democracy and the free press thrived in post soviet russia during the s but yeltsin was confronted with a secessionist movement by the breakaway chechen highlanders who had chaffed under russian rule ever since their brutal conquest in the s the chechens ultimately won the   war for independence and this galled hardliners in russia who vowed revenge  among them was a steely eyed kgbnik named vladmir putin an ailing president yeltsin chose putin to be his prime minister in the summer of  after firing his two predecessors putin was a total unknown to the russian public and it seemed likely at the time that he too would not last long in office  but then came the mysterious september and october  terrorist bombings in moscow and other russian cities which killed approximately  russians in their apartments before any investigation began prime minister putin reflexively blamed the chechens thousands of them living beyond the borders of the breakaway republic of chechnya in the surrounding russian federation were arrested in mass sweeps and raids  putin crudely vowed to clean out the shit house of chechnya and he massed troops to re invade the connecticut sized republic overnight the unknown kgb officer rocketed to fame and became a household name in russia as chechenphobia was fomented by the kremlin to rally support for putin  but even as putins popularity ratings soared in an increasingly racist and xenophobic russia a strange event took place in the russian town of ryazan in october  an alert russian woman called up the police to report seeing a van with mysterious people inside loading white sacks into her apartments basement  when the police came they arrested several men planting bags filled with the rare explosive hexagon the exact outdated world war ii era explosive used in the apartment bombings that killed  russians in moscow volgodonsk and dagestan  the ryazan police chief trumpeted the arrest on television until fsb agents swooped in and freed the imprisoned terrorists putin then implausibly described the remarkable event as a civil affairs test designed to test the readiness of local police  the equivalent would be if fbi agents were to hijack a civilian aircraft after  to test the readiness of the airline industry  while there were many skeptics of putins explanations including one intrepid russian journalist anne politovskaya who exposed russian war crimes in chechnya and was mysteriously murdered in moscow soon thereafter they were silenced as war fever swept russia  an  man russian army then rolled into tiny chechnya to avenge russians who most likely killed by the fsb as part of a false flag wag the dog anti  terror campaign designed to improve putins ratings in russia as in america where president george w bushs rating soared to an unprecedented  after  wars have a rallying effect towards leaders and putins bid for the presidency was based on his masterful channeling war fever   putin solidified his power via a genocidal war  from october  to january  putin then indiscriminately unleashed the vast firepower of the transcontinental russian federation on the breakaway statelet of chechnya ballistic scud missiles rained down on busy markets on the chechen capital of grozny slaughtering civilians strategic bombers flattened neighborhoods with incendiary bombs in the deadliest air attacks since the allied destruction of dresden in  and mountain hamlets were set afire with napalm and fuel air explosives that turned oxygen to fire  as the world looked on in horror putin fulfilled his promise to clean out the shit house of chechnya he declared anyone living in the capital of chechnya grozny to be a terrorist  in what was to be the heaviest aerial bombardment of a city since wwii grozny the largest city on the north caucasus flank was tactically obliterated in what the russians gleefully described as rubbleization  at the time you could actually see grozny and towns to the south of it burning from the satellite images on google earth as tens of thousands of chechens were slaughtered to avenge the  russians killed in the mysterious bombings that no chechens were ever convicted for hundreds of thousands of this targeted race fled for their lives  as the terrified chechens did so russian aircraft bombed the refugees columns and ground troops arrested tens of thousands of chechen men who were labeled in blanket terms as terrorists any chechen fighter was also labeled a terrorist and many who were captured were tortured to death or summarily executed  thousands of the chechen civilian men swept up by the russians were never seen again except in the rare cases where mass graves containing their bodies were unearthed by foreign journalists russian journalists were by now too afraid to report on such war crimes in many cases the bodies often wrapped in barbed wire could not be identified because their faces and hands had been cut off  tens of thousands who did not disappear languished in infamous prison camps like chernokozovo there prisoners were systematically tortured in conditions that were far worse than in the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq only there were no arrests in this case  the man who came to personify the senseless brutality of the russian campaign was one colonel budyanov budyanov was a tank commander who decided to celebrate putins election by breaking into a chechen house kidnapping the familys daughter elza raping her and brutally sodomizing her with various tools driving around with her naked on his tank as she was bleeding from internal damage and then shooting her in the head and throwing her lifeless body in a ditch  when a subordinate reported the crime he was also thrown in a ditch and tortured ultimately budyanov did go on trial due to the fact that western journalists reported on the case russian women threw flowers on this russian army hero at his trials but he was not convicted after he explained to the judge that the chechen girl he raped and tortured was a sniper and that he was suffering from ptsd at the time of the rapemurder  when the genocidal war that saw many such cases of torture and extrajudicial execution was over as much as one fifth of chechnyas population of  million was dead and grozny was totally obliterated  but putin had sealed his reputation as a hardliner who could protect mother russia from its enemies real or imagined as yeltsin retired due to poor health putin won the subsequent presidential election and the unknown kgbnik was now master of the largest nation on earth   before attacking our democracy putin systematically dismantled the free press and subverted democracy in russia  upon coming to power in  putin inherited a country that was experiencing its most liberal period in history the free press thrived and investigative journalists were not afraid to tackle issues such as corruption in the government and there was open democracy  putin the former member of a state police force dedicated to suppressing dissent and defeating western democracy saw this as a threat to his power and quickly moved to quash it  early on putin began to move against investigative journalists who criticized him for his war crimes in chechnya or his illegal business deals that soon made him one of the wealthiest men in the world  at the time several russian journalists were executed in broad daylight for their investigative reports others who dared to expose putins war crimes or tackle the issue of his increasing authoritarianism and corruption were arrested newspapers and television stations that were critical of putin were systematically shut down  within a few years the former kgb operative from st petersburg had reinstituted soviet style censorship and muzzled the press the media in russia today is essentially nothing more than a neutered kremlin mouthpiece and rt  russia toda y is as propaganda driven as tass or pravda were in the soviet period  if this were not enough putin had political dissidents arrested opposition parties shut down and those politicians who resisted him executed by his proxies among them was the brave opposition politician named boris nemtsov who was interviewed by cnns anthony bordain nemtsov was killed in the shadow of the kremlin in the middle of moscows busiest bridge  to compound matters putin stripped away the rights of the provinces to elect their own governors and instead began directly appointing them himself putin is at heart an anti democrat autocrat and has overseen the dismantling of the free press and democracy in his country and death or arrest of his opponents  this puts him squarely in opposition to the core values and beliefs of the worlds greatest democracy which is dedicated to defending democracy worldwide  another russian who represents the lawlessness and brazen corruption of putins kremlin was sergei magnitsky a lawyer working for an american firm in moscow that was the largest foreign investor in the country  when he uncovered cases of mass corruption he was arrested by the authorities tortured and despite american requests for his release beaten to death in prison an outraged congress passed the bipartisan magnitsky bill which barred any official involved in his death from entering america thus infuriating putin   putin invaded ukraine and illegally annexed crimea  in march  putin ordered the invasion of the donetsk region in eastern ukraine and the invasion conquest and annexation of ukraines crimean peninsula  the insertion of russian troops posing as pro russian rebels in the russian dominated donetsk region of the ukraine was done in part to punish ukrainians for turning their back on russia and overthrowing the countrys pro russian leader during the winter   orange revolution  putin was furious when ukrainian protestors overthrew the countrys pro russian leader in a popular revolution against his effort to keep ukraine in moscows orbit  putin made sure ukraine paid a heavy price for turning to the west instead of moscow thousands of ukrainians have been killed in the warfare that ensued and members of the small indigenous crimean tatar community that have protested against the illegal annexation of their homeland have been arrested and never seen again  if this were not bad enough in the summer of  russian backed rebels fighting in donetsk fired a russian supplied buk missile at a malaysian airlines jet passing overhead and in one horrible instant killed  innocent people from various nations around the world who were onboard  while putin denied that russian troops were involved in this shoot down of the civilian airliner there is irrefutable proof that russian soldiers transported the advanced weapons system to the ukraine to assist lightly armed pro russian rebels  the war and misery in eastern ukraine continues to this day despite the fact that america and the european union instituted sanctions against russia to punish it for its illegal actions as of august  russia has closed the straits of kerch to ukrainian ships further crippling ukraines economy to punish it for turning to europe instead of russia   putins brinkmanship with nato risks war  but putins disrespect for international norms was not limited to his own country or the former soviet states that he seeks to dominate for years putin has been ordering russian aircraft to violate nato air space and engage in provocative acts including several near misses between russian and nato aircraft  russian aircraft have also engaged in simulated bombing attacks in areas ranging from the north sea to the baltics to arctic and along the us coastline  russian submarines have carried out intrusions into nato territory including one submarine that was hunted in the swedish harbor of stockholm in  lithuania a member of nato recorded a stunning  intercepts of russian aircraft violating its air space in  nato member turkey shot down a russian aircraft violating its air space  but putins brinkmanship was not limited to americas allies in february  the russian spy ship the viktor leonov appeared just  miles off the coast of virginia in a bold provocation and statement to the newly elected american president  this challenge was to a president who had naively proclaimed he would reboot relations with russia during the election putins dangerous provocations are reminiscent of the cold war violate international law and risk war with america and nato never more so than in the recent massive war exercise russia carried out in belarus with numbers that exceeded treaty limits with nato in order to train for a war with nato   putin committed extensive war crimes in syria  in the fall of  the unpredictable russian leader surprised the world by inserting russian troops into syria to back up the beleaguered assad regime the iranian and hezbollah backed assad regime it should be recalled had been widely condemned by the international community for dropping deadly sarin nerve gas bombs directly on civilian packed cities as well as massive barrel bombs the indiscriminate nature of the attacks horrified the west  assad flouted the geneva conventions and obamas threats to attack assad if he crossed a red line and used deadly weapons of mass destruction on his own people again  president assads forces including the dreaded shabiha death squads were responsible for killing far more people than isis and had been universally condemned by the un for war crimes but by  the butcher of aleppo as assad was known was in retreat american backed rebels known as the free syrian army were liberating sunni lands in the west from assads shiite alawite forces  but all hopes for a negotiated end to civil war that has cost  people their lives ended when putin inserted  russian troops into western syria to bolster the faltering assad regime peace talks were now off the table  with russian mig and even massive tupolev long range strategic bombers flying from southern russia backing their movements the assad regime forces went on the offensive  the cia backed free syrian army sunni rebels begged america for anti aircraft missiles as their positions were pounded by russian cruise missiles and bombs but no heat seeking missiles were given for fear of antagonizing russia the cia trained free syrian army rebels were initially successful in destroying russian made syrian tanks using wire guided tow missiles given to them by the cia but russian hind attack helicopters were used instead as air artillery and the american backed rebels were defeated in idlib province and driven into aleppo  by  the iranians and russian backed government troops had defeated american backed rebels in the proxy war in western syria the rebels then retreated to aleppo the largest city in syria and its economic hub  but if they thought they were safe in this enormous city they were mistaken for the russian air force had already perfected methods for wiping out cities where rebels were based  it should be recalled that the russian air force had turned grozny once the most beautiful city in the northern caucasus into the caucasian hiroshima with zero effort to avoid civilian casualties the russians similarly obliterated aleppo house by house and block by block using weapons banned by the geneva conventions in civilian populated areas  massive tupolev bombers carpet bombed entire neighborhoods and cruise missiles fired from the caspian sea rained down on targets that were inevitably described as terrorists no matter where they landed  tragically over and over again hospitals filled with war wounded patients were targeted by the russian air force as the us government the united nations and human rights groups loudly condemned the airborne slaughter of civilians  this mass killing by bomber epitomized the sort of war on civilians that inspired picasso to paint arguably his most powerful work guernica a protest against the bombing of civilian packed cities  but putin was deaf to the universal condemnation and in the end aleppo like grozny before it was rubbleized and thousands of bodies lay dead in the rubble of a once beautiful city it was this attack that outraged the world that earned putin the grim moniker destroyer of cities   putin attacked us democratic elections  having brutally undermined democracy in his own country putin then launched an unprovoked attack on americas cherished democracy the us intelligence community which consists of  separate services including the fbi cia nsa and directorate of national intelligence unanimously determined that the russian government interfered in the fall  presidential elections in america  in a multi pronged cyber attack russian hackers operating with the intent to undermine public faith in the us democratic process leaked information from the democratic national committee with the aim of undermining the clinton campaign  the russian hackers also meddled in the election by disseminating false news about hillary clinton and stirring up racial tension on facebook posts that reached millions on october   president obama told putin to stop interfering in our election or he would face serious consequences once again putin appeared to be deaf and the campaign continued  the unprecedented assault was aimed to bolster trumps success in the election and put him in the white house instead of clinton who had led the world in denouncing putin for the brutal crack down on massive protests against his rule from   the cyber attacks infuriated both houses of the republican controlled congress which united to condemn the first foreign attack on a presidential election  a bipartisan call for an investigation was issued with both republican and democratic support on december   obama expelled  russian diplomats and essentially confiscated two russian compounds as an act of retaliation putin responded to obamas retaliatory move and congresss approval of sanctions in august of  by expelling over  us diplomats in a move putin called bighting thus putin has one upped the us in his war he began  conclusion  as has can be seen putin is neither a friend of america nor of democracy a cause the us is dedicated to upholding and protecting at home and abroad  despite trumps naive efforts to reach out to the man who earned the epitaph destroyer of cities after leveling two cities grozny and aleppo he is far more of a threat than the north korean leader kim jung un who trump calls rocket man  whether it be his blatant violations of nato airspace or his repeated violations of internationally recognized human rights norms through bombings of civilian targets or extra judicial executions of his own citizens of chechen crimean tatar or russian origin putin stands for everything a moral american leader is opposed to  the wily russian autocrat is a clear and present danger to america and our interests abroad putin the former member of the infamous kgb secret police has the blood of hundreds and thousands of chechen ukrainian syrian crimean tatars and malaysian civilians on his hands he has subverted democracy not only in his own country but in our country  in the authors opinion trumps most presidential act since assuming office was his bold decision to end the bromance with putin by launching a bold cruise missile salvo into a syrian and russian airbase at shayrat in western syria in april  to punish the assad regime for bombing civilians with sarin gas  this was an appropriate response to russian syrian wmd war crimes and far from the sort of appeasement that trump has otherwise displayed towards putin this act demonstrated rare resolve to confront the reality that putin is not our friend on the contrary he is one of our greatest if not chief enemies  from the baltics to the caucasus to aleppo to the coast off of virginia to the houses of the millions of americans who rely on the internet putins aggression knows no bounds  its high time for trump to follow congresss bold decision to stand up to putins aggression and play the role of defiant winston churchill in the face of continued aggression instead of an appeasing neville chamberlain  and the first step in becoming a churchill lies in not believing bald face lies from autocrats of the sort another dictator named hitler told chamberlain before launching his invasions of europe  brian glyn williams is author of inferno in chechnya the russian chechen wars the al qaeda myth and the boston marathon bombing  and the crimean tatars from soviet genocide to putins conquest  and is professor of islamic history at the university of massachusetts dartmouth worked for the cia and us army in afghanistan and has lived and carried out research in

https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-bullying-anti-asian-racism-of-fox-newss-watters-world,the past year has not exactly been a good one for asian americans back during the republican primaries fear mongering politicians talked about asian immigrants and their anchor babies in a way that portrayed an entire race as opportunists thronging to exploit america and its resources on behalf of their offspring after predicating his campaign on deranged anti immigrant rhetoric the republican presidential nominee donald trump gleefully mocked the chinese and japanese using broken accented english during a campaign rally in iowa in august he included filipinos on a list of potentially terrorist immigrants and said were dealing with animals there were also north africans and middle easterners on his list during the first presidential debate china was mentioned twelve times mostly by trump as a threat and hindrance to americas growth  watterss scoop is so full of wince inducing stereotypes that the casual watcher may confuse it with a grade school educational video about the hazards of discrimination fox news  youtube  then on monday night fox news ran a segment on the oreilly factor that bill oreilly the shows host called gentle fun it was so relentlessly odious and flagrantly racist that if you were a chinese immigrant like me i came to america when i was eight years old and am now a citizen you began to wonder with a twist of dread if prejudice had somehow become infectious how many of my fellow americans were laughing at the bigotry along with oreilly and his perennial sidekick jesse watters  this is not the first time that watters a fox news reporter with a stifler esque swagger who does not tend to break actual news but has repeatedly praised trump as the winning guy has targeted minority communities back in april he visited harlem ostensibly to investigate the reasons for hillary clintons success among black voters he ended up posing hard hitters like are there any downsides to having a woman president watters world as his man on the street segment is called seems an appropriate title for a correspondent who seems insistent on inflicting himself and his world views upon hapless strangers  but his latest scoop from chinatown a five minute video is so chock full of wince inducing stereotypes that the casual watcher may confuse it with a grade school educational video about the hazards of discrimination if only am i supposed to bow to say hello watters says to passersby before asking a watch vender if his merchandise is stolen he turns a foot masseuses silence at his innuendo laden commentary into a joke occasionally the screen cuts to clips of the karate kid or  what else  to kung fu movies because obviously__ that is the cultural heritage of all chinese immigrants not that watters cares enough to learn that the chinese even in chinatown speak more than one regional dialect or that there is a difference between what is chinese japanese or korean in a stunning thirty second clip watters asks a man if he knows karate a japanese style of martial arts and then confusingly enough proceeds to attempt tae kwon do a korean style of martial arts with nunchucks which originated in japan the point is clear no one can tell these orientals apart anyway the same smirk was present on wednesday when watters tweeted out a non apology as the backlash against his segment mounted my man on the street interviews are meant to be taken as tongue in cheek and i regret if anyone found offense he wrote as if the problem were that the concept of a joke had to be explained to the humorless chinese  as i write this i fear that i am projecting more bravado than i feel true the rational reflective part of me is indignant and affronted it asks how can it be that the fastest growing racial group in america one that has doubled its share of the electorate in the past decade is subjected to such crass caricature on national tv but the other part is a chinese american woman who viscerally feels the heat of humiliation as watters attempts to grind on the street with two asian american women while the screen inexplicably cuts to clips of japanese schoolgirls dancing in pigtails and skimpy uniforms who feels inward embarrassment when subtitles are inserted for an asian hillary supporter who speaks accented but perfectly intelligible english whose stomach involuntarily drops when watters harangues an elderly woman who clearly understands little english but is too timid or polite to walk away from an aggressive white man yelling about trump beating up on china  at one point watters talks to a young man who is helping in his family store which the host determines sells traditional herbs is there anything that helps with performance he asks with a sideways smile there is a flicker of abashed comprehension on the young mans face um im not going to ask my parents about that he says then watters delivers the i caught you acknowledging my stereotype punchline i mean on television  it all seems so backward but then again so is bullying watching watters world chinatown edition i am reflexively reminded of the shame i felt as a young immigrant with a tenuous grasp of the english language and american culture whose insecurity mutated into mortification on behalf of my chinese parents and an inexorable fear that i might remain like them a perpetual foreigner and an inferior american doomed forever to be at the mercy of those like watters to legitimize myself as a proper citizen of this country there are times when i have wondered despite myself how much distance i must place between myself and those whom watters and trump feel free to mock what must i do to impress the bully  this is the psycho social climate of intimidation with which the trump campaign has bedevilled the country that a buffoon with deplorable manners can endlessly exercise his right to self satisfied idiocy is a scary thing scarier still are the tiny seeds of self doubt he sows in each one of us who has ever been led to believe that those who insult us might somehow be better than us that we should be the ones who are embarrassed that such a man could one day soon be the leader of a nation built by immigrants  now thats a new kind of fear and of shame,TRUE,TRUE

stairs when the bullet ricocheted off a wall and pierced his heart as gurley lay in a pool of his blood on the fifth floor landing with a friend trying to revive him liang passed by without offering help gurley was pronounced dead at a local hospital soon after  less than three months later liang became one of the few police officers to be indicted in a shooting case in february a jury found the former new york city police officer guilty of manslaughter and official misconduct this week justice danny chun reduced his manslaughter charge to criminally negligent homicide and sentenced him to five years of probation with  hours of community service prosecutors say they will appeal the reduced conviction and liangs attorneys are planning to appeal the case too  a wake up call  liangs sentencing marks a culmination of almost a year and a half of fissures among asian americans many have taken to the streets in new york city and in other major cities around the country in support of liang while others have rallied around gurleys family  its a wake up call says erika lee a university of minnesota history professor and author of the making of asian america lee says liangs case has mobilized a level of asian american activism not seen since the  los angeles riots and the  killing of vincent chin in a detroit suburb  the debate about liangs case comes from a long history of different kinds of activism by the asian american community lee argues there are these two traditions of asian americans both acting for ethnic specific causes and issues as well as joining others especially since the s she says  in her book lee highlights protests during world war ii by japanese american no no boys who after being forced to live in internment camps refused to comply with the military draft and loyalty questionnaires that discriminated against us citizens of japanese ancestry she also writes about other asian american activists like yuri kochiyama and grace lee boggs who were among those who got their start in the african american civil rights movement  enlarge this image toggle caption craig ruttleap craig ruttleap  is liang a scapegoat  many asian american activists supporting liang ask why he was put on trial when so many white officers have not been charged in other police involved deaths of black men they also question whether liang has received enough support from a predominantly white police department and officers union  weve seen bureaucracy corruption and lots of shirking of responsibility that have led to peter liang becoming a scapegoat jerry lo of long island said in cantonese as he stood with other chinese american protesters across from the kings county supreme court after the sentencing  laura lam of manhattan arrived outside the courthouse two hours before the sentencing was scheduled to begin to join other liang supporters she chafed at the suggestion that her support for liang has anything to do with race dont bring race into it it should be very pure its about justice only lam said in cantonese adding that shes heartbroken that an innocent man has died and a young cops career has been cut short i feel very sad its bad for both sides  she said that liang should not have been charged instead lam put most of the blame on the nypd for sending liang with another rookie cop to patrol the louis h pink houses as well as the public housing developments management for not making sure the stairwell was properly lit at night its hard for her to understand she said why anybody especially asian americans would blame liang for what she sees as an accident  not just a black persons struggle  across the street standing among gurley supporters ting lin of brooklyn said she also doesnt think liangs race should play a role in this

queens said liang supporters should not see him as a victim and should instead rally around the gurley family i think we as east asian americans we have to acknowledge the anti blackness within our own communities that does in my belief play a part in their support for peter liang he said  you have to fight for your rights  wu yiping helped organize many of the new york city rallies in support of liang he credited the protests by liangs supporters around the us for helping to bring about what many consider a light sentence liang received no jail time but he could have been sent to prison for as long as  years for his original manslaughter conviction  wu argued that the sentence showed the importance of voting and participating in mainstream society in the us american society wont give you rights you have to fight for your rights wu said in mandarin  he added that the way forward includes finding opportunities for the african american and chinese american communities to better understand each other  the reason why there hasnt been that communication is because chinese people are focused on their careers he said and we dont think about doing other things wu suggested that chinese restaurateurs and other business owners operating in african american communities can do more to give back to the community  they should go into their churches speak with them and try to understand what they need we can even prepare free chinese lunches for their children or donate money during the holidays he said  a troubling ebb and flow  regardless of the ultimate outcome of the liang case there are questions about how long the political energy it generated within the asian american community on both sides can be sustained lee the author of the making of asian america says theres a troubling ebb and flow to activism by asian americans who are positioned in the us racial hierarchy as both victims and also protected from some of the harshest types of racial discrimination  we do have this privilege of not always having to pay attention to these issues and then sometimes when it does hit our community hard its a very politicizing moment because it feels new she adds we may be shocked into thinking this could happen to us too when we thought we might have been protected  lee says asian americans are facing a pivotal moment as the countrys fastest growing racial group and that the groups demographics are changing in other ways too many of the new immigrants from china are coming with higher levels of economic and political clout and they may be better primed to get involved with causes than previous generations of working class chinese immigrants lee adds  still the liang case has not only exposed a growing range of opinions within the increasingly diverse asian american community for some asian americans it has also re energized a commitment to stand with other communities of color in solidarity  something has been awoken something has been established lee

although the work released  years ago this month doesnt completely shy away from the superhero tradition of comics the graphic novel is grounded in small school age moments that weigh heavily on its asian american characters the well meaning teacher mispronouncing a students name the blatant racism found in schoolyard taunts and difficulties of trying to fit in  the book features cousin chin kee as in chinky who is a mishmash of some of the worst historical    and modern    american stereotypes used against asians  sometimes a stereotype needs to be dressed up in bright yellow skin and a queue in order for folks to recognize its severity yang once said queue refers to a hairstyle historically worn by men in china  chinese won several awards and became the first graphic novel to be nominated for the national book award yang has since worked on avatar the last airbender comics released a set of two graphic novels on the boxer rebellion called boxers  saints and is partly responsible for a new spin on superman for dc comics new super man chronicles how a  year old in china inherits the man of steels powers  after receiving a genius grant from the macarthur foundation last week the pbs newshour spoke with the award winning author on american born chinese the inspiration behind the grotesque chin kee and the one regret he has about his cherished graphic novel  congratulations on the macarthur award whats it like being dubbed a macarthur genius  it was completely out of left field it has not stopped being nuts its something thats been really hard for me to wrap my head around  youre one of few cartoonists to be crowned a genius in the history of the award as someone who has said that comics dont make you sexy how has public opinion of comics changed in the past decade  i still stand by that statement but i do think comic books have gotten a little bit sexier not to the point of actually being sexy yet though i do think its really different now than when i started  i started doing comics as an adult in the mid to late s back then nobody knew what a graphic novel was the graphic novel section in most libraries was stuck with non fiction youd go to a bookstore and maybe theyd have a shelf of graphic novels or they would shelve calvin and hobbes next to maus it wasnt the same general public awareness that there is today so i feel incredibly lucky to be involved in comics during this incredible growth period  your award winning graphic novel american born chinese was released  years ago this month its a coming of age tale that ultimately weaves three stories together can you tell me how this particular graphic novel got started  when i started it was not a graphic novel i started american born chinese as a mini comic series so i would finish a chapter id print it up at my local kinkos id staple it by hand and then id sell it id sell it through stores mostly at university of california berkeley there was a store called comic relief that use to carry comics on consignment id try to sell it by hand at the end of the day maybe id sell a dozen or two at that time i had a dream of eventually collecting it into a graphic novel but to have it full color to have it from the big book publishers that was well beyond what i was thinking at the time  why was american born chinese a story best told in comic form  for about five years i had done a few stories with asian american protagonists but their cultural heritage never played an important part of the story i knew i wanted to do some kind of story where that was the focus because my own cultural heritage played such an important part in how i find my place in the world  for american born chinese i really wanted to tackle stereotypes head on i just think its more powerful when you do it visually like if i were to describe the cousin chin kee character to you in text i dont think it would have the same sort of emotional impact as seeing him on the page  right the character of cousin chin kee who is an amalgamation of some of the worst stereotypes of yesteryear is a needle scratch as soon as he appears in the graphic novel can you tell me about his creation  what i really wanted to do was tie historical images of chinese americans asians and asian americans with what i was seeing in pop culture at the time i think the modern american can look at the buck toothed images of chinese and chinese americans that were really prevalent in the late s or early s as modern americans we can recognize that as racist but then there were also a lot of things that were happening all around me that i felt were connected to that but most people didnt draw that connection  for instance in the early months of working on the book an incident happened that we now refer to as the chinese spy plane incident where a chinese or american fighter plane went down in or around chinese air space depending on how you took the facts  as a response an american by the name of pat oliphant drew this political cartoon of uncle sam going into a chinese restaurant and being served by a slant eyed buck toothed waiter hes served a plate of crispy fried cat gizzards with noodles  so when i saw that to me it was obvious it was obvious that oliphant was drawing from the same old racist roots i was just a little bit shocked that nobody else thought that way in the book i wanted to connect those things together  there were lots of other things too the popularity of william hung is very controversial among asian americans he was the american idol contestant a lot of people feel that there was something racist about how infatuated america got with him  i hadnt realized that some of the racist inspirations for chin kee were culled from times as early as the aughts since american born chinese has been published can you name other moments in american pop culture when cousin chin kee just keeps coming back so to speak  i think theres a general question of why havent asian americans been featured more prominently in american media i think thats definitely changing i think we are now seeing asian and asian looking faces in our movies on television and even in books at an increased rate i still dont think that were where we want to be i just think for a lot of americans their idea of an asian or an asian american is pretty two dimensional  how did people originally respond to the character when the graphic novel was published  i would say ive gotten different types of feedback about the cousin chin kee character some older asian americans told me when they got to that character it was so painful for them to look at it was hard for them to finish the book and that was what i was kind of going for  some other asian americans around my age or people who are younger who grew up in a minority setting where theyre not around a lot of asian americans they totally understand they think hes funny and they understand that hes funny in this really painful way  if i were to do the whole thing over again i would try to exaggerate the cousin chin kee character even more then maybe people would not find him cute  and then    it hasnt happened in a while    but every now and then somebody will come up to me usually its at a comic book convention and theyll say you know that cousin chin kee character hes so cute do you have a t shirt with him because hes so cute and i was not going for cute when i designed that character  one of the regrets that i have with the book like if i were to do the whole thing over again is i would try to exaggerate the cousin chin kee character even more to cut down on some of that  oh wow thats an actual regret you have  yeah i feel like i didnt exaggerate him enough if i had exaggerated him a little more then maybe people would not find him cute  shifting to another character in american born chinese we also see the story of jin wang and his struggle to assimilate into american culture jins experience feels so personal it appears to mirror your own struggles growing up as a son of immigrant parents did you hide your true self  i think i wanted to that feeling of wanting to divorce myself from my own cultural background from my cultural heritage is a lot of whats behind the book  jin wang is actually a misspelling of my name that i encountered more than once my parents were originally going to give me the name j i n like the character in the book and they decided not to because they felt like if they could find an english name that was close that it would give me a leg up in american society so they found g e n e  but even so people would still misspell my name j i n from time to time i just thought it was a weird thing you know gene is an actual american name but people still misspelled my name as jin same with wang so a lot of times my last name will get misspelled wang and ive talked to other yangs and other wangs and that does seem like a pretty common thing  a lot of the racism that jin and his friends experience were pulled from my own life especially from late elementary school into junior high  at one point an herbalist tells jin that its easy to become anything you wish  so long as youre willing to forfeit your soul im curious whether you had a similar epiphany    that you were avoiding your true self  i dont think it was one point i think it was actually throughout my college years this was the early s at berkeley that was when i first started calling myself an asian american before that i called myself oriental that was the first time i was in a majority asian environment it wasnt even a majority during my four years that was when asian americans became the largest group numerically  so for the first time i was around a lot of other asian americans it wasnt weird being asian american didnt stand out i took some sociology classes i talked to my asian american friends who were a lot wiser than me who thought through these issues and i think that was when i started being able to explain and understand the discomfort i had had since i was a kid and it was also the time that i realized that it wasnt just me this experience of feeling like an outsider wasnt unique to me it was actually a very common thing especially among immigrant kids  right in fact we see in american born chinese that stereotypes dont just affect jin one of his friends suzy opens up to him about being the target of a racial slur and its such a painful panel to see suzy try to process the hatred she witnessed in that moment as a parent do you have conversations with your children about stereotypes and how to react to them how to process them  i do i do i have talks with them im not totally sure they understand what american born chinese is all about maybe thats a good thing  the school they go to is predominantly filipino and they are half chinese and half korean and i wonder if they feel like outsiders or not my feeling is that they probably dont because a lot of the parents of their friends are like me my kids friends are the grandkids of immigrants so theyre one generation removed from the immigrant experience and i think in a lot of ways filipinos east asians southeast asians do tend toward a more collective asian american identity especially as you get further away from the immigrant experience right  im lucky i get a chance to talk to different folks about my work and it seems like when i meet young asian americans in communities where theres a large enough asian american population they just never felt like an outsider and even though its bad for my royalties its probably good for the next generation to have my book feel a little bit alien  youre the first graphic novelist to be named the library of congress national ambassador for young peoples literature ultimately what would you want young minds to take away from a work like american born chinese  i hope that a kid who has never felt part of the majority a kid who has always felt like an outsider will understand regardless of what it is that makes them an outsider that that is not an experience thats unique to them actually more of us feel like outsiders than insiders in a weird way that kind of ties us all together  interview has been edited and condensed  read more rebecca sugar cartoon networks first female creator on writing

https://www.summitdaily.com/news/aspen-hedge-fund-manager-accused-of-rape-in-garden-of-farm-to-table-restaurant/,denver    for the two teenage boys watching something about the interaction between the younger married man and the older single woman was amiss  theyd just seen the  year old boys aunt and the man whose wife and three children socialized mere feet away lock arms and walk down a garden path toward the darkness at the end where the japanese lanterns ran out  thats weird and suspicious the  year old said to his  year old friend i thought why were they so close to each other walking up the path  the married man was aspen developer and hedge fund manager nikos hecht now  who was on vacation in cabo san lucas mexico with his family the woman was suzanna dailey now  who was on vacation that evening of march   with her sister and her sisters family  dailey is suing hecht in us district court in denver alleging that he raped her that night at the end of the garden path  the two boys    who are now juniors in high school    did not appear wednesday in us district judge r brooke jacksons courtroom instead daileys lawyers headed by jennifer altman played the boys videotaped depositions from october  for the jury of five women and two men  dailey testified tuesday that after chivalrously offering to walk her through the vegetable gardens of a fancy farm to table restaurant hecht grabbed her by the back of the neck forcefully kissed her then threw her to the ground and sexually assaulted her  hecht has not testified yet in the trial though his lawyer promised jurors during an opening statement tuesday that he would hechts attorney also offered a version of events far different than daileys which included a consensual sexual encounter between the two that was prompted by a flirtatious and dirty talking dailey  but what neither dailey nor hecht knew during whatever happened between the two of them that night was that daileys  year old nephew and his  year old friend were watching them from behind a bush  to  feet away  at more than an hour and  minutes daileys nephews deposition testimony was by far the longer and more detailed of the two the mop haired teen who at the time of the deposition was  snacked on bowls of popcorn and pretzels as he related what he and his best friend since first grade stumbled onto that night  he said he saw hecht offer his arm to dailey and watched the two of them walk away from the main group at the restaurant which included members of three current or former aspen families when they were about  yards away daileys nephew turned to his friend  we both had the same thought of wanting to investigate he said  the boy had been playing with and keeping an eye on hechts young son at the time so he handed him off to another teen nearby and they took off he said they didnt follow hecht and dailey up the garden path though instead they looped around by moonlight through the cabbage fields in their bare feet until they came upon the couple about  yards up the path he said both boys estimated that dailey and hecht were out of sight for about a minute and a half  the  year old said he and his friend crouched behind a bush and could see perfectly but could not be seen  he said he saw his aunt laying on the ground on her back with her arms above her head and her cargo shorts around her ankles hecht was first upright on his knees looking down at her then was directly on top of her with his pants pulled down to his knees  he said he saw hecht thrust into dailey around  times but did not witness actual penetration the entire incident lasted about three minutes  we both could hear grunts from mr hecht he said though he heard nothing from his aunt  the boy said later in the deposition he loves his aunt and would have done something to stop the incident if he thought she was being attacked he said he assumed it was a consensual act  i dont recall there being any signs from her that would put fear in her voice or actions he said  the other boy also said he thought he was observing consensual sex and would have intervened if hed thought anything violent was occurring  at the time the boys whispered to each other they thought the two were having sex but soon high tailed it out of there before either hecht or dailey rose from the ground the  year old said  me and his best friend were flustered because we were scared he might see us he said  the boys circled back around through the fields and returned to the dinner pavilion the party soon began to break up but he said he didnt say goodbye to either his aunt or hecht  i was just like weirded out or freaked out he said it was just really effed up to see that kind of stuff  the broad spectrum of why someone would do that with their kids there their wife there and suzy with her  year old mother there and for a  year old kid to see was big  he said he went up to his mother daileys sister and told her he had just seen something that involved hecht and dailey and that they were an item  i didnt know how to break it to my mom he said  his mother jeanne andlinger testified earlier wednesday that she was busy trying to get her elderly mother and husband ready to leave when her son who was somewhat agitated told her hed seen hecht and dailey walking down the path arm in arm  thats not an item she said she told him and continued preparing to leave  however the two boys approached her again before the crew left the restaurant and her son said he really had something to tell her andlinger said  i saw them she said he told her i saw them doing it  that got her attention andlinger said  i looked at him in disbelief she testified did you see a bare bottom i said he said yes i said whoa something has gone wrong  her son said he told her not to tell anyone  i remember thinking im gonna tell someone he said in the deposition  almost immediately upon getting into a van full of teenagers whod been at the gathering for the drive back to his hotel he spilled the beans he said  we were all stunned and shocked he said and we were laughing  the next day he said he talked to his mom again and asked her a question  is this normal he said he asked i didnt know if it was normal  andlinger testified that her sisters demeanor was different after she returned to the table that night  i saw her sitting at the picnic table like a stone she said  dailey said she had something to tell her but andlinger told her they would talk first thing in the morning andlinger in fact didnt hear about the alleged attack until the next morning though she said she didnt think at the time the sex had been consensual  hechts lawyer marci labranche hammered her on cross examination about that decision why labranche asked if you cared so deeply for your sister didnt you go to her that night a juror asked a question through the judge along those lines  andlinger said she was worried about her son worried about her sister worried about leaving the restaurant with her mother and husband and worried about the lengthy discussion with her sister she knew she had to have  i regret not going to her room that night she said it wasnt because i didnt care about what took place i was overwhelmed by the situation  in the end she said her sister is a strong person and she knew suzy was going to be ok  the trial continues

https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/mystery-behind-ghost-visits-dreams,have you ever seen or met a ghost when youre fast asleep that is in a dream if you havent had a ghost dream so far theres every likelihood you may experience one in the future thats because dreams that involve contact with a ghost or spirit generally known as visitation dreams are quite common what does it mean if you see a ghost in a dream is it just a trick of the mind or is there something more to being visited by a ghost in your dream there are many explanations and many possibilities some of them scientific some of them spooky some of them historical some of them traditional some of them supernatural and so on each one of them equally intriguing  dreams are in fact considered one of the most effective ways for the spirit realm to connect to the living according to american writer and artist nina kahn perhaps dreams allow a little opening in our consciousness for the mystical realm to slip through  offering us a time to experience enhanced clairvoyance divine inspiration and even messages from the dead scientists truthfully know so little about dreams or why everyone has them so creepy as it may be its worth it to open your mind to the possibility that maybe spirits can visit people in dreams to deliver messages warnings and beyond anne reith phd and founder of the institute for mediumship psychic astrological and reiki training explains that it is actually easier for spiritual entities of all kinds eg deceased loved ones guides angels to communicate with us while we are sleeping partly because youre more likely to be receptive to it in a dream than you would be in a waking state  but how do you know its actually a spirit trying to communicate with you through a dream or its just a dream created by our subconscious maybe after weve heard or read or seen some ghostly reference visitation dreams are typically clear vivid intense and are experienced as real visits when the dreamer awakens the dreamer is always changed by the experience explained patrick mcnamara phd an associate professor at boston university school of medicine  in countries and cultures around the world dreams have been regarded and treated as spiritual experiences since ancient times ancient chinese and mexican civilisations believed dreams allowed them to communicate with their ancestors ancient greeks and romans considered dreams to be divine guidance brent swancer an author and crypto expert provides more details on such fascinating traditional beliefs tales and myths of dream dwelling entities and apparitions can be found in all cultures he says with the descriptions of such mysterious entities varying as much as the people who dream them japan has its baku also known as eaters of dreams  china has its dream walking fox spirits st lucia has its creepy dream spirits called the kokoma which come in the form of babies that beat their victims with furious little fists in germany these entities were called the trud or alp and they were said to come to people or even animals in their dreams to press down on them and in some cases even crush the victims to death with the german word for nightmare alpdrucke coming from their name medieval europe had its old hags which were spooky apparitions that similarly invaded dreams to immobilise or hold their prey down and there were also the incubi and succubi which were dream demons that sexually assaulted their victims and fed off of sexual energy in anglo saxon and old norse lore these dream demons were called the mart or also the mara mahr or mare which is indeed the origin of the english word nightmare which comes from the word nightmart  it is interesting swanker points out further that even now in the modern age sleep and dreams remain virtually as mysterious as they always have been when we dream we might as well be venturing out to the boundaries of the known universe for all we know about them but do such apparitions exist manifesting as shadowy but comforting forms or terrifying forms in our dream world or instead of a supernatural explanation is there some other explanation such as a scientific one for such phenomena amongst others alice m gregory a sleep researcher wrote last year that certain phenomena such as sleep paralysis provide an alternative to paranormal explanations for such occurrences when we sleep we cycle through different stages we start the night in non rapid eye movement or nrem sleep  which gets progressively deeper we then cycle back until we hit rapid eye movement or rem sleep during rem sleep we are most likely to have vivid dreams at this stage we are also paralysed perhaps as a safety mechanism to stop us acting out our dreams so that we dont end up attempting to fly  but during sleep paralysis features of rem sleep continue into waking life those who experience it will feel awake yet might experience dream like hallucinations this experience is pretty common occurring in around eight per cent of people although estimates vary dramatically depending on who we are asking its even possible to induce sleep paralysis in some people by disrupting their sleep in specific ways certain researchers believe that this explains a huge number of paranormal accounts  gregory herself raises an absorbing question and attempts to answer it sleep paralysis aside how else is sleep researchers helping to explain paranormal experiences explosive sounds in our sleep are explained by exploding head syndrome a term coined relatively recently by the neurologist jms pearce when we fall asleep the reticular formation of the brain stem  a part of our brain involved in consciousness  typically starts to inhibit our ability to move see and hear things when we experience a bang in our sleep this might be because of a delay in this process instead of the reticular formation shutting down the auditory neurons they might fire at once our hope is gregory summarises that scientific explanations of paranormal experiences might help others by lowering anxiety  however as has been pointed out repeatedly scientists attempts to dismiss ghosts in dreams as misfiring brain chemistry and derailed sleep cycles is hard to reconcile with many reports from reliable personalities that describe actual physical symptoms of attack effects on the real world or episodes witnessed by other people complete with inexplicable physical phenomena such as moving objects,FALSE,FALSE

https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/how-annihilation-establishes-a-unique-brand-of-body-horror,at one point in annihilation the formerly confident anya thorensen gina rodriguez has a meltdown it begins with her staring at her hands with horror in her eyes later after she has tied up her teammates she fights back tears as she tells them that her fingerprints are moving  since entering the shimmer    a mysterious ever expanding area of land where mutations are common and logic seems nonexistent    anya and her colleagues have been trying to hold on to their own conceptions about biology and physics but their bodies betray them no longer can they rely on the one thing that has been a constant up until this point theyre up against something that can change their very dna  annihilation revels in body horror with a small number of cringe worthy sequences each as grotesque and mysterious as the last it isnt unique in how it uses the trope    the film comes from a long tradition of sci fi horror films where an unknown alien entity threatens humanity    but what it does offer is subtlety and the reversal of the audiences expectations the people at the center of the film all women are going to get distorted and destroyed that much is obvious the mystery lies in how it will happen  to watch anyas downfall in annihilation is to observe the gradual realization that your body is turning against you when she first walks into the shimmer she like the rest of her expedition group are confused and wary but mostly optimistic even if theyre technically on a suicide mission but when faced with the first real evidence of what happened to the former expedition groups anya exhibits intense denial when a video shows a man with his insides moving around like eels she calls it a trick of the light when she sees what happened to that man later she still cant quite believe it  elsewhere in the group lena natalie portman acknowledges a bruise on her arm when she takes samples of it later she watches as her cells evolve and swirl lena had originally volunteered for the expedition because of her husband who returned from the previous mission seriously ill and unlike himself she must have feared in that moment that shed discovered exactly what had happened to him  josie tessa thompson who spends the bulk of the film shying away from the group based in part by a shame regarding self harm or so were told sheds her sleeves and slowly turns into a plant calmly walking into a field to join the others who have been changed sheppard tuva novotny used to be a part of the expedition but she had recently been killed torn apart by something resembling a bear its only after anyas meltdown that the bear shows up once again sporting a skull on its head and sheppards scream in its throat  credit paramount pictures  by the end of the film the shimmer has taken control the characters    and the audience    are unsure of what this strange force wants but as evidenced by all the mutations and what lena says at one point it seeks to create something new the shimmer is about life its not about destruction but creation in a sense its giving birth appropriate considering lena begins the film by explaining the process of creation in cancer cells  even though annihilation is a movie about birth none of the characters in fact give birth which is refreshing since the beginning of time when a woman is besieged by a force greater than herself    supernatural or natural    and she is changed that change often starts in her uterus  this trend started long before we had movies and tv to absorb mythology is filled with stories of women impregnated by gods in  a woman named mary toft managed to convince top surgeons that she had given birth to rabbits the history of body horror is filled with women being attacked from the inside out to become not just mothers but mothers of monsters  the s saw a rise in american body horror as an explosion in technology the space race and fears of communism shook the public prompting horror scenarios like invasion of the body snatchers and many episodes of the twilight zone in many of these earlier films the fear was that our way of life would be replaced and worse that we wouldnt be able to tell it was happening until it was too late  but the horror and science fiction genres were set to keep expanding and changing rosemarys baby  is probably the most ubiquitous of these modern stories thanks to a tense semi ambiguous runtime that leads the audience to question whether the title character was impregnated as part of a satanic ritual it ends in a predictable fashion yes she did give birth to the antichrist but the psychological impact of the ordeal has already been done rosemary longs to be there for her child even if it isnt human because it is hers and she went through the pains of a stressful pregnancy for it  credit paramount pictures  likewise in the  remake of the fly veronica geena davis lives out her worst fear after discovering the transformation of her lover seth brundle jeff goldblum into the titular fly she has a nightmare where she gives birth to their child only instead of a human one it takes the form of a giant fly larva the fly directed by david cronenberg is famous for its grotesque body horror sequences somehow managing to top watching goldblums skin fall off with the image of a woman giving birth to something that is clearly not hers not natural no human buffy angel charmed the brood and a number of other examples utilize this trope which is effective as shorthand for power and control  its a trope that continues to gain steam the  horror film prevenge tells the story of a woman whose fetus tells her to kill as a symbol for a womans loss of control during pregnancy in many of these cases the woman is used as a vessel controlled by a higher power for a purpose not her own films like rosemarys baby and prevenge are noteworthy since they tell the story from the womans point of view the latter is especially obvious about this loss of control with both the protagonist and the audience in on the joke about evil fetuses  however annihilation manages to sidestep this completely a story explicitly about birth avoids the pregnancy body horror trope in favor of other forms of creation in the film along with the book series by jeff vandermeer the extraterrestrial force behind the shimmer acts opposite of humanity which engages in self destruction  in annihilation body horror reflects different forms of creation whether its the growth of flowers or in the formation of a new species rather than the normalized human destruction  this is all a precursor to the ending where the force inside the shimmer uses lena to replicate itself lena makes it to the epicenter    a lighthouse    and has an encounter with a faceless humanoid that starts to replicate her every move it eventually morphs and becomes her taking her place in the human world its the worst possible outcome for a body horror scenario where youre entirely erased and replaced however director alex garland is able to do this without evoking tired imagery about pregnancy or an extreme focus on the body itself for a film that stars five women thats a huge feat  credit paramount pictures  thats because the horror doesnt simply focus on the body in annihilation the body is a means to an end and any changes to it are almost inconsequential if your intestines turn into slithering eels or branches start growing out of your arms its not as a way to destroy the body rather its just another way to keep life going which is what your body is meant to do in the first place the shimmer is only changing the means at which this is done in nature and is that really so horrifying,FALSE,FALSE

Celia Israel has taken aim at the controversial practice of conversion therapy for minors, proposing to penalize state-licensed counselors and therapists who attempt to change children’s sexuality or gender identity. In 2015, Israel’s first session, her bill was referred to committee but never debated. In 2017, history repeated itself. But last week, for the first time, the Austin Democrat’s proposal was debated in a public hearing, where she and other supporters exhorted lawmakers to put an end to a practice they said has proven harmful and sometimes led to abuse. Others spoke in favor of the practice, calling it healing and positive. There was no vote; that historic hearing is as far as the bill will make it this session. Midnight Monday marked the Texas House’s effective deadline for advancing bills out of committee — without a favorable vote by then, House bills are all but dead.",FALSE,FALSE

He couldn’t leave the car. It’s not that he didn’t want to help. It was the death threats he had received recently that kept him in. “I can’t even go out and help a fellow person in the community because I’m afraid that I might get attacked,” said Nguyen, whose restaurant was vandalized and spray-painted with racist slurs after he spoke out against Gov.

police statistics show    accounting for  of all hate crime incidents investigated by the nypd in   nypd hate crime task force records show  incidents in all involving asians with  of them classified as other corona    starting with the march  report of an attack on an asian new yorker in midtown  thats a ninefold increase over the three incidents probed in   reported hate incidents occurred on the subway during a walk to work in grocery stores even outside home while taking out the garbage after china took center stage globally as a source of viral spread  arrests have been made for  corona related hate crimes according to the nypd but no one has yet been prosecuted said chris kwok an attorney and board director of the asian american bar association of new york  we are just as shocked as anyone else kwok said we think there is a lot of fear  the nypd did not respond to a request for comment  lunar new year celebrated by many asian new yorkers begins friday during a normal year the occasion was marked with a massive parade in lower manhattan attracting tens of thousands of spectators a lion dance performance confetti flying in the air and the streets festooned with red and gold decorations  this year the celebrations are subdued and mostly virtual the annual parade is shelved until the spring  there is the fear of contracting the virus theres also an undercurrent of anxiety about the rising violence advocates said  people are afraid about their everyday lives its been this way since  said joo han deputy director of the nonprofit asian american federation its really unnerving  officials with city hall said there will be extra police presence around lunar new year celebrations and asian communities across the city  this is not new for us  the city commission on human rights which investigates bias complaints took in  cases last year involving anti asian incidents a nearly sevenfold rise over the previous year  carmelyn p malalis chair of the nyc commission on human rights said in a statement that when the commission first began receiving reports of anti asian discrimination we knew this was a harbinger of things to come  we all must now take up the mantle of this work in coalition on the local level and across the country to stand up for our asian brothers and sisters she said adding that reports to the commission are confidential and can be made anonymously  the statistics still fail to fully record the full picture say community leaders  is it an uptick is it the fact that more asians are being attacked now or that theres a way to document it that wasnt there before asked jan lee co founder of neighbors united below canal referring to cellphone videos that help capture incidents and prove race was a factor in a crime  this is not new for us its not like we were walking around for  years peacefully and suddenly because of the coronavirus this started  to classify an incident as a hate crime police must show it was motivated because of the identity of the victim    often by citing words used by suspects in conjunction with violence  the law as it is does set a very high bar said kwok who believes the absence of a hateful slur should not disqualify an incident from being categorized as a hate crime it cant just be you dont meet this bar lets just move on  many crimes experienced by undocumented asian new yorkers go unreported advocates noted while incidents that do reach the authorities dont seem to be prioritized  in july when an  year old asian woman was slapped and set on fire by two teenagers in bensonhurst brooklyn the police concluded that the incident did not qualify as a hate crime  the perpetrators have yet to be formally charged with a crime said don lee a volunteer for homecrest community services who said he was interpreting for the victim throughout the nypd investigation  we were told to be on standby to do a lineup the call never came lee said when i called back they said it was already

california and new york according to an analysis by a national group tracking anti asian hate and discrimination during the pandemic  activists and elected officials across the country have called on authorities to act swiftly and to bring perpetrators to justice  last august the nypd formed a permanent task force of  asian american police officers speaking a multitude of languages to investigate anti asian hate crimes chief of detectives rodney harrison said then that the department had seen a spike in every borough throughout the city combined with a reluctance from victims to cooperate with police  the move has met with pushback from some within new york citys asian communities in september more than two dozen groups signed on to the asian american feminist collectives statement opposing the task forces creation  the creation of this task force is a thinly veiled operation to get more cops in asian communities the statement said asserting that survivors of anti asian harassment do not call the police because they fear the police  also opposing the uses of hate crime legislation to further expand systems of criminalization the groups urged investing instead in increased language services and cultural competency training for business owners  community groups said they have been hosting training sessions for members on how to handle a hate crime as a victim or a bystander even sharing self defense strategies  more information sharing and collaboration between community groups city agencies and authorities is needed said alice wong chief of staff at the chinese american planning council  someone may report to the attorney generals hotline but not report to the police she said  the asian american bar association released a report thursday recommending the ability to report to authorities online and through a hotline anonymously and in multiple languages and for police and prosecutors to more consistently and rigorously consider evidence that would allow them to bring hate crime charges  while safety measures in hot spot neighborhoods and training are essential says han of the asian american federation she wants more asian new yorkers to raise awareness and

belong to a veteran of the countrys anti war movement right on cue the crowd repeated each high pitched yell of abe wa yamero abe quit   first at normal pace and then with a rhythm borrowed from hip hop and inspired by pure unadulterated rage  then in english a simple statement that has come to define a japanese summer of public discontent the likes of which it has not seen in a generation this is what democracy looks like  amid the trade union and civic group banners were colourful bilingual placards held aloft by a new generation of activists who have assumed the mantle of mass protest as japan braces for the biggest shift in its defence posture for  years  by the end of this week the prime minister shinzo abe and his ruling coalition are expected to pass a series of security bills that reinterpret parts of japans war renouncing constitution to allow troops to fight overseas for the first time since the end of the second world war  he insists that the changes will enable japan to respond more effectively to security threats from a more assertive china a nuclear armed north korea and islamist terrorism opinion polls show a majority of voters oppose the move  one of the nightly protests by members of sealds outside the japanese parliament photograph guillaume bressionthe guardian  it is testament to the disquiet the protests have caused that abe appears determined to pass the bills by friday ahead of five straight days of public holidays that could bring even bigger crowds out on the streets    the suspicion that he is abusing his coalitions comfortable majority to railroad the bills through parliament has brought teens and people in their s on to the streets in unprecedented numbers  the most prominent group students emergency action for liberal democracy   sealds for short   has its roots in public opposition to the  state secrets law under which whistleblowers and journalists face imprisonment for revealing and reporting sensitive information  with every gathering outside parliament sealds members are challenging the notion that protesters in japan must be above a certain age an eccentric or a marxist ideologue they are not embarrassed about their interest in fashion and music and they are comfortable about replacing their predecessors radicalism with a simple faith in freedom and democracy  they are galvanising other age groups said koichi nakano a politics professor at sophia university in tokyo sealds projects the image that you can be normal and fashionable and political at the same time  beniko hashimoto   works in fashion industry  beniko hashimoto photograph guillaume bressionthe guardian  i came to a demonstration on my own last year and noticed there were lots of young people i hadnt had many opportunities to discuss politics so it was fun to demonstrate with other people my age to be honest i wasnt always interested in politics i kept up with the news but it never occurred to me to join a demo the catalyst for me was the debate over collective self defence when i come to a demonstration i get a proper feel for the public mood and im inspired to do more  even though japan hasnt been attacked the idea of attacking another country or going to war alongside say america doesnt make sense the us might be grateful for our help but can we be sure that they will protect us in any case what are they supposed to be defending us from were always hearing about how china is a threat to japanese national security but is that really the case  i know that some politicians have called us selfish well if its selfish to oppose war then yes i suppose i am selfish young japanese arent as politically aware as people in other countries but thats because weve been educated to think that way theres a tendency in japan to believe that because someone in power says everything is going to be ok then it will like prime minister abe is always saying there is no risk of japan being dragged into a war  erina nakagawa   university student  erina nakagawa photograph guillaume bressionthe guardian  i became involved in the anti war movement quite recently on my birthday this june i took part in a sit down protest there were lots of older people there and one of them gave me a pamphlet about sealds  the way the security bills are being pushed through parliament amounts to the destruction of democracy and constitutionalism the japanese constitution guarantees respect for human rights and is pro peace it calls on everyone to work together to realise its aims and now abe has come along and decided he wants to destroy all that  ive always been moved by john f kennedys speech the one in which he talks about not shrinking from our responsibility to defend freedom that way of thinking is reflected in the japanese constitution i cant accept that one person can come along like some kind of king and declare it null and void  the point of politics is to promote the common good so were the complete opposite of selfish in what were doing were defending our rights   its as simple as that  moeko mizoi   university student  moeko mizoi photograph guillaume bressionthe guardian  my grandmother lives in fukushima so when the nuclear accident happened i remember thinking that political decisions really do have a direct effect on my life i was at high school at the time but none of my friends were interested in politics last year i went to a protest and realised there were other young people who felt the same way i did  the constitution is something we should treasure   especially article nine which renounces war as a means of solving international disputes for the past  years japan hasnt killed anyone overseas and no japanese have been killed in war thats an incredible thing with collective self defence the risk of people dying will be much higher  we all have the right to make our individual voices heard to come together and share our ideas  thats why were here in front of parliament just about every night  people who say we are selfish seem to think that citizens are there to be used by their country including making them go to war it should be the other way round   the nation is there for the benefit of the people  i agree that in general young japanese are indifferent to politics when i think back to when i was at school i had no friends with whom i could talk about politics but later i spoke up and found that actually lots of people are worried about whats happening with the security bills  takuya   high school student  takuya photograph guillaume bressionthe guardian  i joined the anti war group for teenagers because for the first time something was happening politically that i thought would have an impact on my life if this law goes through it will make it easier for japan to go to war for whatever reason   it could be economic not just political that will affect not just me but my school friends too  i wouldnt say i was influenced by my family or by a public figure i just felt moved to get involved my dad talks about politics and he has encouraged me but my mum is worried she thinks that what were doing is a little dangerous  people have said that getting involved so publicly at my age could damage my job prospects i honestly dont think that when im job hunting in a few years time that ill be asked about my political activism if i am ill be honest and if i dont get the job then that probably isnt the right company for me anyway  this movement will continue even after the security bills pass its not just about one issue   there are lots of other things that worry me about the abe government im not old enough to vote so joining these protests is the only way i can make my feelings known  hikaru   high school student  hikaru photograph guillaume bressionthe guardian  i attended my first demonstration in june but my political awakening happened after the march  nuclear disaster in fukushima i talked about what had happened with my family my older sister was already an anti nuclear activist so she took me along to a demonstration i met other people my age there so i decided to get properly involved  when i first heard about the security bills i was worried i felt it affected me  i kept thinking about what could happen if this really became law people have called us naive but does anyone really want japan to go to war even the people who support the security bills its natural to want to avoid war so i dont think im being naive or selfish at all  my friends used to think i was a bit strange but some of them have been coming up to me at school and saying youre doing a good thing  at this point the most important thing is to defend democracy   to make sure theres a discussion before any decisions are made my parents influenced me to an extent but ive always liked the beatles and im a huge fan of john lennon the japanese singer kiyoshiro imawano has also been a big influence,FALSE,FALSE

if taking a selfie the woman snapped a picture and sent it to a friend whose reply showed up in big font on the womans phone oh no is he chinese  across the aisle from chou was a man she later learned is korean american and a woman sitting next to him also of asian descent the woman quickly replied to her friend theres a lot of them pray for me  chou knows her experience was not an anomaly across the us chinese americans and other asians are increasingly living in fear as the coronavirus spreads across the country amid racial prejudice that the outbreak is somehow the fault of china it is a fear grounded in racism but also promoted from the white house as donald trump   and his close advisers   insist on calling it the chinese virus  this is becoming more widespread said chou an associate professor of sociology at georgia state university my fear is coughing in public coughing while asian and the reaction other people will have  the last few weeks has seen a rise in racist incidents and comments directed toward asian americans tied to fears of coronavirus  last week trump started to refer to covid  as the chinese virus  the united states will be powerfully supporting those industries like airlines and others that are particularly affected by the chinese virus we will be stronger than ever before read one tweet on  march the first time he referred to the illness as chinese virus online  it comes from china thats why it comes from china i want to be accurate donald trump  trumps use of the phrase sparked a chorus of criticism professional basketball player jeremy lin told trump on twitter that he should be instead supporting vulnerable people including those that will be affected by the racism youre empowering author celeste ng noted on twitter that asians worldwide are facing actual harassment because of people who insist on calling the illness the chinese virus  trump doubled down on the name at a press conference on wednesday insisting that using the term is not racist it comes from china thats why it comes from china i want to be accurate trump said  trump has received support from his allies who have defended the president for giving coronavirus a new name china is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that  thats why china has been a source of a lot of these viruses john cornyn a republican senator from texas told a reporter when asked if the name was inappropriate  trumps new name for coronavirus comes after weeks of racist attacks against asian american seen across the country an asian woman in new york city wearing a face mask was assaulted and called diseased in early february by a stranger in a subway station in los angeles a man directed a racist rant about coronavirus to a fellow passenger who is asian  one family in fresno california had their car tagged with the word fuck asions  and coronavirus a middle school student in california was told by his teacher to go to the nurses office after he coughed though he told his teacher that he choked on water and was not sick when he asked his teacher why he didnt ask non asian students to go to the nurse after coughing he was told to let it go and move on  the increasing frequency in incidents is something we have to take seriously said gregg orton national director of the national council of asian pacific americans ncapa racial scapegoating is the exact opposite response we want to see from leaders of our country  ncapa led a group of  civil rights organizations in sending a call to congress to denounce anti asian racism around coronavirus the congressional asian pacific american caucus sent a letter to their fellow members of congress urging them to share verifiable information about the illness given the misconceptions about national origin and the spread of the virus  asian american history scholars point out there is a long history of anti asian discrimination in america that gives precedent to racist attacks against asian americans because of coronavirus  close from the very beginning chinese immigrants were seen as inferior filthy and diseased said claire jean kim a professor of political science and asian american studies at the university of california at irvine when chinese immigrants came to america in  they were painted as a threat to the white working class leading to racist attacks and segregation chinatowns were seen as filthy and full of scum  the increasing frequency in incidents is something we have to take seriously gregg orton  what is being accomplished by using this kind of language kim said were being misled about what causes pandemics and how to possibly prevent them or reduce their severity in the future thats the kind of conversation that we need to be having  there is also a history of leaders painting those in an outsider group as diseased evoking fear and often violence in their followers toward that group of people said susan benesch a faculty associate at the berkman klein center for internet and society at harvard  benesch coined the term dangerous speech rhetoric that is used to turn one group of people violently against another that chinese people are unhygienic and unsanitary is a very old feature of dangerous speech against chinese in america  its not really hatred that is the most operative emotion regarding dangerous speech its fear fear is what makes people turn violently against another group of people more than hatred benesch said the level of fear is so great around this epidemic  as the coronavirus and its effects appear to be long lasting advocates in the asian american community emphasize the importance of speaking up and calling out any racist remarks when the environment is safe  we have to acknowledge everyones humanity at this time because the virus doesnt know race or color chou said,FALSE,TRUE

https://www.todayonline.com/world/fears-trade-war-spike-after-trump-announces-sweeping-steel-aluminum-tariffs,"WASHINGTON — United States President Donald Trump's announcement that he would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has drawn sharp criticisms and threats of retaliation from major trade partners, heightening fears of a global trade war. Mr Trump’s decision, which makes good on a key election campaign promise, sent world stocks tumbling on Friday (March 2) and drove investors toward the traditional safe plays of government bonds and the Japanese yen. China’s Foreign Ministry predicted harm to trade if other countries follow the US example, while its Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Friday that it will take measures to safeguard its interests if US trade measures hurt China, echoing comments made earlier by Canada, Brazil and the European Union. ""China hopes the US respects the multilateral trade system and maintains a normal trading order with the rest of the world,"" Wang Hejun, head of the Commerce Ministry's Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau, said in the statement. But striking a defiant tone, Mr Trump said on Friday that trade wars were good and easy to win and threatened to impose reciprocal taxes on imports from trade partners. ""When a country taxes our products coming in at, say, 50 per cent, and we tax the same product coming into our country at zero, not fair or smart,"" he said in a tweet. ""We will soon be starting reciprocal taxes so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. US$800 billion (S$1.1 trillion) trade deficit-have no choice!"" When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018 In a hastily arranged meeting with industry executives that stunned many inside the White House a day earlier, Mr Trump had said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect “for a long period of time.” The action, which came against the wishes of Mr Trump’s pro-trade advisers, would impose tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminum, effectively placing a tax on every foreign shipment of those metals into the US. “People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,” Mr Trump said. “They’ve destroyed the steel industry, they’ve destroyed the aluminum industry, and other industries, frankly.” “We’re bringing it all back,” he added. Mr Trump’s authority to impose such sweeping tariffs stems from a Commerce Department investigation that concluded last month that imported metal threatened national security by degrading the American industrial base. The administration has said it wants to combat cheap metals flooding into the US, particularly from China, but a broad set of tariffs would fall most heavily on allies, especially Canada, which supplies steel and aluminum to American companies as well as the military. Data shows that Canada supplies 16 per cent of US demand for steel versus China’s 2 per cent and is by far the largest steel exporter, followed by Brazil and South Korea. Li Xinchuang, vice secretary general of the China Iron and Steel Association, described Mr Trump's move as ""extremely stupid"" and “a desperate attempt to pander to his voters”. “The US is now setting a very, very bad example,” he added. “Nothing can be done about Trump. We are already numb to him.” Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian minister of foreign affairs, called any measure that deemed Canadian trade a national security threat “entirely inappropriate.” “Should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,” she said. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, called the measure “blatant intervention to protect US domestic industry” and said the EU had been a close security ally of the US for decades. “We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk,” Mr Juncker said. The EU will consider imposing its own “safeguard” tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium in response to the US move, Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU trade commissioner told Financial Times. Global trade will be harmed if countries follow the example of the US, China’s foreign ministry said on Friday in response to Mr Trump’s announcement. “In recent years, the global economy has still recovered slowly and the basis for the global recovery is is still unstable,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing in Beijing. “All countries should make concerted efforts to to cooperate to resolve the relevant issues, instead of taking trade restrictive measures unilaterally,” she added. South Korea said it will keep talking to US officials until Washington’s plans for tariffs are finalised. Mr Trump took to Twitter on Friday to defend his decision, tweeting: “When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down US$100 billion (S$131 billion) with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!” When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018 In a later social media post, the Republican president said his aim was to protect US jobs in the face of cheaper foreign products, a familiar theme in the ""America First"" credo he campaigned on for the 2016 election. ""We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. If you don't have steel, you don't have a country!"" he wrote. Mr Trump had told more than a dozen executives on Thursday that he wanted the tariffs to apply to all countries, one executive in attendance said.
